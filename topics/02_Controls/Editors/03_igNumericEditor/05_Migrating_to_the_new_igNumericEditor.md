# Migrating to the new igNumericEditor

With the 15.2 release of Ignite UI™ a new set of editor controls were introduced including a reworked `igNumericEditor`. With a new design focused on simplicity and better UX out-of-the-box some features and their API were revised, removed and new ones added. This topic will cover the differences that will be helpful for developers migrating their applications to the new editors.
