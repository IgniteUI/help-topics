# Styling igScheduler

## Using Themes

The `igScheduler`™ utilizes the jQuery UI CSS Framework for styling and theming purposes. By default, the `igScheduler` uses the IG Theme which is a jQuery UI theme provided by Infragistics for use in your application.

To customize a theme, you can use ThemeRoller. ThemeRoller is a tool provided by jQuery UI which facilitates the creation of custom themes that are compatible with jQuery UI widgets. Many pre-built themes are available for download and use in your website. The `igScheduler` control supports the use of ThemeRoller themes.
