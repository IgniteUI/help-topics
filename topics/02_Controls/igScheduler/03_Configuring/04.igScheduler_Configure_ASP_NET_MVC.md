# Configuring ASP.NET MVC Scheduler
%%ProductName%% is a JavaScript-based [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) control suite that you can use to build rich, interactive web applications. When %%ProductName%% is paired with ASP.NET MVC, you have the option to use JavaScript directly or with the MVC Helpers provided in %%ProductName%%.

The MVC Helpers are a collection of .NET classes and extension methods that generate the HTML markup and JavaScript required to work with %%ProductName%% controls. Once rendered to the page, there is very little difference between code you may write by hand using a JavaScript-only approach and what is rendered by %%ProductName%% MVC Helpers, but using the helpers may be a good choice for you if:

* You feel more comfortable working with MVC view engine syntax or in managed code rather than HTML and JavaScript

This document is focused specifically on explaining the igScheduler MVC Helper. Along the way you'll become familiar with the different syntax options available when constructing a view as well as the different approaches available to you in working with the server to provide data to the scheduler.

> **Note:** This document shows sample code using the Razor view engine and in C#.

## <a id="getting-started"></a> Getting Started
Before you can use the igScheduler MVC Helper, you must first create a reference to the `Infragistics.Web.Mvc` assembly and reference the proper scripts and style sheets on your page.

### <a id="referencing-igniteui-mvc-assembly"></a>Referencing the %%ProductName%% MVC Assembly
Begin by creating a reference in your ASP.NET application to the %%ProductName%% MVC assembly which is found at this location:

```
%%InstallPath%%\MVC\<MVC_VERSION_NUMBER>\Bin\Infragistics.Web.Mvc.dll
```

### <a id="referencing-styles-and-scripts"></a>Referencing Styles and Scripts
Next, you need to reference the required style sheet and script files on your page.

```html
<link type="text/css" href="css/themes/infragistics/infragistics.theme.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link type="text/css" href="css/structure/infragistics.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-ui.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.core.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.lob.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.scheduler-bundled.js"></script>
```
> **Note**: Due to the nature of how the %%ProductName%% MVC Helpers operate, you must include references to jQuery, jQuery UI and %%ProductName%% at the top of the page.

## <a id="syntax-variations"></a>Syntax Variations
When using the %%ProductName%% MVC Helpers, there are a few different parts that compose a page that are relevant to using the igScheduler. As a page is requested, Model data is collected in the Controller and passed to the View so the %%ProductName%% MVC Helpers can render the control on the page. In the controller you would have to pass a Model class, which containes two representations of the `Appointments` data and `Resources` data, which are form of an `IQueryable<T>` collections, where `T` is represention either `Appointment` model or `Resource` model . Every of the two Models should inherite `IModel` interface, which is located on `Infragistics.Web.Mvc.IModel` namespace and should implement `ToJson` method, which represents the `JSON` representation of the model.

> **Note**: The igScheduler MVC Helper `data source` and `resources` accepts only instances of `IQueryable<T>`. 

> **Note**: If `Render` method is not invoked, the control won't be visualised. 

Therefore, as you use the igScheduler MVC Helper you use syntax that follows a pattern like this:

```html
@(Html.Infragistics().Scheduler()
    .DataSource(/* collection of the appointments data */)
    .Resources(/* collection of the resources data */)
    .Render()
)
```

### <a id="syntax-scheduler-model"></a>Scheduler Model
The first option available to you in configuring the igScheduler is to define all the options for the scheduler (including the data source and resources) in the controller and simply pass the personaly created scheduler model, which would be, two collections representations of `Resource` and `Appointment` models to the Helper. As an example, here a controller creates an instance of the personaly created class and sets the `DataSource` and `Resources` properties to an instance of an `IQueryable<T>` collections.
```csharp
using Infragistics.Web.Mvc;

...

public class SchedulerModelController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        PersonRepository repository = new PersonRepository();

        SchedulerModel model = new SchedulerModel();
        model.DataSource = repository.Appointments.GetAll();
        model.Resources = repository.Resources.GetAll();

        return View(model);
    }
}
```
Now with the scheduler model being personally created and sent to the view, the MVC Helper is passed the view's Model to render the control.

```html
@using Infragistics.Web.Mvc
@model Project.Namespace.Models.SchedulerModel

...

@(Html.Infragistics().Scheduler()
    .DataSource(Model.DataSource)
    .Resources(Model.Resources)
    .MonthViewSettings(mw =>
    {
        mw.WeekNumberVisible(true);
        mw.WeekdayVisible(true);
    })
    .WeekViewSettings(wv =>
    {
        wv.TimeSlotInterval(SchedulerTimeSlotInterval.SixMinutes);
        wv.WeekViewDisplayModel(SchedulerWeekViewDisplayMode.All7Days);
        wv.WorkingHoursDisplayMode(SchedulerWorkingHoursDisplayMode.WorkingHoursOnly);
    })
    .DayViewSettings(dv =>
    {
        dv.TimeSlotInterval(SchedulerTimeSlotInterval.SixMinutes);
        dv.DayViewDisplayMode(3);
    })
    .Render()
)
```
Notice that the page requires a `using` directive to import `Infragistics.Web.Mvc` at the top of the page to make the API available in the view. The `model`'s declared type is your created model, which matches what was passed to the view by the controller. Since the return type for the `Scheduler` method in this case is `MvcHtmlString` (which ultimately is the rendered string of HTML and JavaScript for the page), no further method calls are required to render the control.

<a id="scheduler-model-source"></a>If you were to view the source of the page rendered as a result of this example you will see something like this:

```html
<div id="scheduler"></div>
```
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(function () {
        $('#scheduler').igScheduler({ 
            height: '700px', 
            width: '1200px', 
            dataSource: [ 
                {
                    "id":11,
                    "resourceId":1,
                    "start":"2017-04-08T00:00:00",
                    "end":"2017-04-08T00:00:00",
                    "subject":"Some Subject",
                    "location":null,
                    "description":"Description"
                }, 
                {
                    "id":5,
                    "resourceId":6,
                    "start":"2017-04-10T00:00:00",
                    "end":"2017-04-10T00:00:00",
                    "subject":"Some Subject",
                    "location":null,
                    "description":"Description"
                }, 
                {
                    "id":10,
                    "resourceId":11,
                    "start":"2017-04-20T00:00:00",
                    "end":"2017-04-20T00:00:00",
                    "subject":"Some Subject",
                    "location":null,
                    "description":"Description"
            ], 
            resources: [ 
                {"id":1, "displayName":"grape", "colorScheme":"Teal"}, 
                {"id":6, "displayName":"grape", "colorScheme":null}, 
                {"id":11,"displayName":"grape","colorScheme":null}
            ], 
            monthViewSettings: { 
                isWeekNumberVisible: true, 
                isWeekdayVisible: true 
            }, 
            weekViewSettings: { 
                timeSlotInterval: 'sixMinutes', 
                weekViewDisplayMode: 'all7Days',
                workingHoursDisplayMode: 'workingHoursOnly' 
            }, 
            dayViewSettings: { 
                timeSlotInterval: 'sixMinutes', 
                dayViewNumberOfDays: 3 
            } 
        });
    });
</script>
```
It's not important for you to understand everything in this code listing at the moment, but this is included to help you get an understanding of the type of code rendered as you use the MVC Helper. Notice that a HTML `DIV` element is generated with an `ID` of `scheduler`. Then in the `SCRIPT` element, just after the jQuery `ready` anonymous function, is the jQuery selector of `$('#scheduler')` runs which associates the data and options to the declared `DIV` element.

#### Appointment and Resource model example
The following section will show you an example of `Appointment` and `Resource` model representation. Both examples will use `Newtonsoft.Json` for easy and fast serialization of the objects.

```csharp
    public class AppointmentItem : IModel
    {
        [JsonProperty("id")]
        public int ID { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("resourceId")]
        public int ResourceId { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("start")]
        public DateTime Start { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("end")]
        public DateTime End { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("subject")]
        public string Subject { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("location")]
        public string Location { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("description")]
        public string Description { get; set; }

        public string ToJson()
        {
            return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(this);
        }
    }

    public class ResourceItem : IModel
    {
        [JsonProperty("id")]
        public int ID { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("displayName")]
        public string DisplayName { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty("colorScheme")]
        [JsonConverter(typeof(StringEnumConverter))]
        public SchedulerResourceColorScheme? ColorScheme { get; set; }

        public string ToJson()
        {
            return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(this);
        }
    }
```
> **Note**: When you want to create `ColorScheme` property which is part of the `Resource` model representation. The type of it, should be `Infragistics.Web.Mvc.SchedulerResourceColorScheme`, which is enumeration representation of all 12 posible colors, that you are able to use as a resource color scheme. Also, explicitly it has to be set what the representation of this enumeration should be. As it shown, it has to be, the string value of the enumartion.

### <a id="syntax-chaining"></a>Chaining

The defining of the scheduler model happens with the chaining syntax. When you pass in a collection of data into the MVC Helper, the `Scheduler` method returns and instance of `SchedulerWrapper` that exposes a fluent interface allowing you to chain method calls to define the controll on your page.
