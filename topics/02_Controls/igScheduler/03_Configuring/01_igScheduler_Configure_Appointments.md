# Configuring Appointments (igScheduler)


## Purpose

This topic explains the concept of the appointments in the `igScheduler` control and provides examples on how to bind and perform CRUD operations  with those appointments.

## Overview

The appointments are used to represent an event which starts at a specific time and ends at a specific time. The appointment can be associated with a resource, which means that the resource (a kind of entity, for example a person) is the owner of the activity represented by that appointment.

It is important to note that the scheduling control is built by the `igSchedulerCore` and the `igScheduler` controls. The `igSchedulerCore` is the engine and the `igScheduler` runs the user interface.

The `igScheduler` works with appointments that are simple JSON objects, containing only the properties listed in the [Appointment object properties section](#appointment-properties). The collection of appointments, assigned to the `dataSource` option by the developer, needs to contain this type of appointments.

At the same time the `igSchedulerCore` maps these objects to another type of appointment objects. In comparison to the other type of appointments, the appointments of the `igSchedulerCore` do not contain the properties listed in the [Appointment object properties section](#appointment-properties), but expose getter and setter methods with the same name and more. Please refer to [Appointment object methods section](#appointment-properties) below for more information.

The crossing point between those type are the events triggered on user interactions with the `igScheduler`. Attaching to a certain event, the developer may access the appointment that is being created, edited, etc. However, the developer may need to call .dataObject() in order to retrieve a simple JSON object representing the activity, and this JSON object then may be passed to other methods to work with it.

### Code example

The developer access the appointment that is created and then programatically creates the same event for a different location:

```javascript
$("#scheduler").igScheduler({
	dataSource: appointments,
	resources: resources,
	appointmentCreated: function (evt, ui) {
		console.log(ui.appointment.dataObject());
        ui.appointment.dataObject().location = "London";
        ui.owner.createAppointment(ui.appointment.dataObject());
	},
```

##<a id="appointment-properties"></a> Appointment object properties

The following table lists the Appointment's key properties and their purpose:

Property |	Purpose 
---|---
id | This property is used to distinguish this activity amongst all other appointments. It must be unique. | 
subject | This `string` property is used as short description of the activity. It is the main information shown in the controlâ€™s views and therefore used to distinguish a specific appointment amongst the other appointments.
location| This `string` property is used to store the location where the appointment takes place.
start | This `Date` property contains the start date and time of the appointment.
end | This `Date` property contains the end date and time of the appointment.
resourceId | This property is used to associate the current appointment with a resource.
recurrence | This property holds the recurrence pattern for the appointment.

##<a id="appointment-properties"></a> Appointment object methods

The following table lists the Appointment's key methods and their purpose:

Property |	Purpose 
---|---
id | Gets the `id` property value that is used to distinguish this activity amongst all other appointments. | 
subject | Gets/sets the `subject` property value that is used as short description of the activity.
location| Gets/sets the `location` property value that stores where the activity takes place.
start | Gets/sets the `start` property value that contains the start date and time of the appointment.
end | Gets/sets the `end` property value that contains the end date and time of the appointment.
resourceId | Gets/sets the `resourceId` property value that is used to associate the current appointment with a resource.
resource | Gets the resource object that is associated with the current appointment with.
recurrence | Gets/sets the `recurrence` property value that holds the recurrence pattern.
recurrenceId | Returns the `ID` of the root recurrence activity or null if the activity is not associated with a recurrence.
isRecurrenceRoot | Returns a boolean indicating whether this appointment is a recurrence root activity.
recurenceRoot | Returns the recurrence root activity or null if the appointment is not associated with a reccurence.
dataObject | Returns a simple JSON object with the properties listed in the [Appointment object properties section](#appointment-properties)

### Code example

The appointments are a collection of JSON objects, containing all or some of the appointment`s properties:

```javascript
var appointments = [{
        "id": 11,
        "start": new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 2, 6, 45),
        "end": new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 3, 6, 45),
        "subject": "Marketing conference",
		"resourceId": 1
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "end": new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 3, 12, 45),
        "start": new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 3, 13, 45),
        "subject": "Dentist appointment"
		"resourceId": 6
    },
    {
        "id": 10,
        "start": new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 4, 8),
        "end": new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 4, 8, 30),
        "subject": "Distributions sync",
        "description": "Sync with distributions team"
		"resourceId": 11
    }
],

$("#scheduler").igScheduler({
    height: "650px",
    width: "100%",
    dataSource: appointments
});

```

## Getting all appointments in time range

A collection of all appointments for the given time range can be retrieved by the [getAppointmentsInRange method](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igscheduler#methods:getAppointmentsInRange)

### Code example

```javascript
var appointment = $("#scheduler").igScheduler("getAppointmentById", 4);
```

## Adding appointment through the API

Appointments can be added by using the [createAppointment method](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igscheduler#methods:createAppointment) by passing the appointment object as an argument .

### Code example

```javascript
var appointment = $("#scheduler").igScheduler("createAppointment", {
    id: 1,
    subject: "Some subject",
    location: "Somewhere",
    start: new Date(2017, 04, 05, 12, 30),
    end: new Date(2017, 04, 05, 12, 30),
    resourceId: 4,
    description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit."
});
```

## Editing appointment through the API

Appointments can be edited by using the [editAppointment method](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igscheduler#methods:editAppointment) that is taking as parameters the appointment object and an object containing the properties that will be changed.

### Code example

```javascript
var appointment = var appointment = $("#scheduler").igScheduler("getAppointmentById", 4);

$("#scheduler").igScheduler("editAppointment", appointment, {
    subject: "Some subject",
    location: "Somewhere",
    start: new Date(2017, 04, 05, 12, 30),
    end: new Date(2017, 04, 05, 12, 30),
    resourceId: 4,
    description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit."
});
```

## Deleting appointment through the API

Appointments can be deleted by using the [deleteAppointment method](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igscheduler#methods:deleteAppointment) which needs to be passed the appointment object as an argument.

### Code example

```javascript

$("#scheduler").igScheduler("deleteAppointment", appointment);
```
