### igZoombar

Issue | Description | Status
---|---|---
`igDataChart` Radial Series not supported| `igZoombar` supports only horizontal zooming while Radial Series zooming makes sense only when done on both axes. Because of this, zooming Radial Series with `igZoombar` does not work properly. |![](../../images/images/negative.png)
[igZoombar thumbnail not rendered when used with igDataChart](igZoombar-Known-Issues-And-Limitations.html#thumbnail)| `igZoombar` creates its thumbnail by using the options of the `igDataChart` control (which is referenced in `igZoombar` ‘s [target](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igzoombar#options) option). `igZoombar` trims off some of these options in an attempt to remove the clutter from the thumbnail. This can make the new option set invalid.| ![](../../images/images/positive.png)

## igZoombar
### <a id="thumbnail"></a>igZoombar thumbnail not rendered when used with igDataChart

`igZoombar` creates its thumbnail by using the options of the `igDataChart` control (which is referenced in `igZoombar` ‘s [target](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igzoombar#options:target) option). `igZoombar` trims off some of the options attempting to remove the clutter from the thumbnail. This can make the new option set invalid.

>**Workaround:** Use `igDataChart` options to initialize `igZoombar` by configuring its [clone](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igzoombar#methods:clone) option.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$("#zoombar").igZoombar({
      target: "chart",
      clone: {
            // use igDataChart options
      }
});
```

### <a id="synchronize"></a>The clone and the target widget of igZoombar doesn’t synchronize automatically

Changing the widget being zoomed by the `igZoombar` control does not
update the clone automatically.

>**Workaround:** Using the `igZoombar` public API, retrieve the element on which the clone is initialized and apply the same changes on it. When updating the `igDataChart` instance, also update its `igZoombar` thumbnail clone using the [clone](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igzoombar#methods) API method.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$("#dataChart").igDataChart("addItem", {"Item1": "Value1", "Item2": 1000, "Item3": 1019.75}, "series1" );
$("#zoombar").igZoombar("clone").igDataChart("addItem", {"Item1": "Value1", "Item2": 1000, "Item3": 1019.75}, "series1" );
```
