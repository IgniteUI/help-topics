# igCheckboxEditor Known Issues

## Known Limitations

-   Using the `igCheckboxEditor` as a labeled control by a HTML `label` element is supported out-of-the-box only when the widget is initialized on an `<input>` with the respective ID directly. This is due the default browser behavior (clicking a label to activate and toggle the editor) being applied when the target ID is a form control.
