# How to localize the Editors

There are two types of localization. First is for the localization resources in the controls. Second is for the regional settings in the controls.

Localization resources for the controls are in Bulgarian, Russian, Japanese, German, Spanish and French languages. These reside in js/modules/i18n (where js is the root folder for the JavaScript files in the Ignite UI program installation path). To get more into using the localization resources you can read the ["Customizing the Localization of Ignite UI Controls"](customizing-the-localization-of-netadvantage-for-jquery-controls.html) topic.

The regional settings, on the other hand, provide region specific formats for dates, numbers, as well as currency symbols, floating point symbols, decimal separators, default decimal rounding, etc. These reside in the ../js/modules/i18n/regional (where js is the root folder for the JavaScript files in the Ignite UI program installation path).

## Use cases

The `regional` option allows you to provide great experience to your users if you are targeting a specific geographic region or culture. 

The `igDatePicker` and the `igDateEditor` are the two editors which look is affected the most by the `regional` option. If you need to be sure that your users from a specific region will see the editors in the context they are expecting to see it, just set the desired regional value and the editors will show the date format appropriate for the culture. This includes localized month and day names as well as default date and time formatting patterns. 

For the `igDatePicker` the `regional` option sets the calendar month names and the day names in the language, what day is considered to be the first of the week or if the language of your users is written right-to-left. This will also update the `igDatePicker` calendar labels like the next and previous month buttons. 

If you set the `regional` option when using the `igNumericEditor`, `igCurrencyEditor` or `igPercentEditor`, the component will use the correct negative pattern, decimal separator and group separator for the given culture. It will also show the correct currency symbol and will provide the expected context to your users. 

Here is an example how to initialize a `igDatePicker` control with Bulgarian regional settings:
```js
$('#editor').igDatePicker({ regional: "bg" });
```

## Example

In this sample we show how a culture can be set to the editors' `regional` option to change the default formatting of dates, numbers and currencies. Three regions are configured here (United States, Japan and Tamil, India) and there are many more to choose from in the infragistics.ui.regional-i18n.js file.
