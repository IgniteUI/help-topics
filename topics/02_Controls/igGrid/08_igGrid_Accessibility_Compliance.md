# Accessibility Compliance (igGrid)

### In this topic

This topic contains the following sections:

-	[Section 508 Compliance](#section-508)
-	[WAI-ARIA Support](#wai-aria)

## <a id="section-508"></a> igGrid Section 508 Compliance

All of the Ignite UIâ„¢ controls and components comply with Section 508, Subpart 1194.22 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Table 1 contains the specific rules of Subpart 1194.22 that pertain to the control. Also detailed is how the grid control complies with each rule.

To meet the requirements each accessibility rule, in some cases, you may need to interact with the control by to setting a specific property, but in other cases the control does the work for you.

> **Note:** As jQuery controls are client-only, some of the rules are not supported and are marked as limitations.

## <a id="wai-aria"></a> WAI-ARIA Support

In 2014 the W3C finalized their [WAI-ARIA specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) which defined how to design Web content and Web applications to be more accessible to users with disabilities. The igGrid has been designed so that it follows these guidelines.

The list below provides details about what changes have been made to the igGrid to support WAI-ARIA. Please note that no special settings are  needed to leverage these changes, as they are all enabled by default.

<ul>
<li>All elements of the igGrid render a <b>tabindex</b> attribute with a corresponding value from the <b>tabindex</b> option of the igGrid, which allows access to the elements through the use of TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys.</li>
<li>The igGrid is decorated with a <b>grid</b> role.</li>
<li> The header elements are each decorated with an <b>aria-label</b> attribute with the column header text, which allows the header text to be read instead of the <b>title</b> attribute value when a <b>title</b> attribute is present.</li>
<li> The thead, tbody, and tfoot elements are all decorated with a <b>rowgroup</b> role</li>
<li> The rows are decorated with a <b>row</b> role.</li>
<li> Row selector elements are decorated with a <b>rowheader</b> role.</li>
<li> Table cell elements inside of the table body rows are decorated with a <b>gridcell</b> role. </li>
<li> Table cell elements inside of the table body rows are decorated with <b>aria-describedby</b> attributes with a value set to the <b>id</b> of the corresponding columnheader element of the column the table cell belongs to. </li>
<li> Table cell elements inside of the table body rows are decorated with <b>aria-selected</b> attributes when the selection feature is enabled. By default the value of the <b>aria-selected</b> will be <b>false</b> unless a row is selected initially in configuration.</li>
<li> The table is decorated with an <b>aria-multiselectable</b> attribute when the selection feature is enabled. The value of this attribute depends on the value of the <b>multipleSelection</b> option of the selection feature.</li>
<li> The igHierarchicalGrid's expandable row cell elements in the table body are decorated with <b>aria-expanded</b> attributes with a value corresponding to the expanded state.</li>
</ul>
