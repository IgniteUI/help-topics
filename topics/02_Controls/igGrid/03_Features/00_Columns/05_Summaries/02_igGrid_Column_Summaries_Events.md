# Column Summaries Events (igGrid)

## Topic Overview

### Purpose

This topic explains the events that are specific to the Column Summaries widget of the `igGrid`™.

### In this topic

This topic contains the following sections:

## <a id="overview"></a> Events Overview 

There are three events that are specific the Column Summaries widget. (See the Events Reference Chart block below). All the events that suffix is ‘-ing’ are cancelable and the propagation can be terminated when in such handler we return false.

**In Javascript:**

```js
$("#grid1").igGrid({
   features: [
    {
        name: 'Summaries',
        showDropDownButton: true,
        summariesCalculating: function (e, args) {
              return  false;
        }
     }
   ]
});
```

Most of the argument methods and properties contain a row specific data, as well as the grid they belong to.

## <a id="attach-handlers"></a> Attaching Handlers to Events in jQuery and MVC 

To attach to an event, you just need to define a handler for it, in the same way you define a property. Now, if the event is triggered, the handler will be called.

**In Javascript:**

```js
$("#grid1").igGrid({
    features: [
        {
            name: 'Summaries',
            showDropDownButton: true,
            summariesCalculating: function (e, args) {
            // Handle event  
            }
        }
    ]
});
```

When attaching a handler in MVC, you need to use the jQuery UI pattern which is a concatenation of the names of the control and the event in lowercase letter format.

**In Javascript:**

```js
$("#grid1").live("iggridsummariessummariescalculating", function (e, args) {
	// Handle event  
});
```

> **Note:**
> The jQuery live function is used in case some DOM elements are added after attaching to the handler.
