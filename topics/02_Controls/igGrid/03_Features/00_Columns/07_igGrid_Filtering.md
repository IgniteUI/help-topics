# Filtering (igGrid)

## Overview

The Filtering feature of the `igGrid` allows users to do Excel-style filtering of data.

> **Note:** Filtering is implemented as a jQuery UI widget which follows the lifecycle of any jQuery UI widget.

## <a id="persistence"></a> Filtering Persistence

Persisting Filtering between `igGrid` re-bindings is made easy in version 14.1 and in fact replaces the previous default behavior.

> **Note**
> Filtering persistence is true by default. This is a breaking change.

When you enable `igGridFiltering` you are already using it in a [`persist`](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.iggridfiltering#options:persist) mode. This means that after explicitly calls of **dataBind()**, that persistence is applied for UI and data source view (the filter editors are not cleared and the data source remains filtered)

Filtering persistence is implemented for `igHierarchicalGrid` too.

If you would like to retain the previous behavior of filtering being cleared after user re-binds the *igGrid*, you can do this by disabling the feature through the [`persist`](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.iggridfiltering#options:persist) option as shown in the code snippet below:

**In JavaScript:**

```js
features: [
  { 
     name: “Filtering”, 
     persist: false 
  }
] 
```

## <a id="modes"></a> Filtering Modes

The mode option accepts two value values: advanced or simple. When the simple filtering mode is set, all filters are rendered for every column header, below the respective column header cell. When advanced filtering is configured, then an advanced filtering button is rendered next to the column header text (default). Once the advanced button is clicked, the “advanced” filtering dialog appears where more complex filtering conditions are available to the user.

## <a id="considerations"></a> Configuration Considerations

-   All filter row conditions are always combined using the “AND” operator.
-   The advanced filtering dialog does expose the “AND” or “OR” operators in order to combine multiple filters.
-   The advanced filter dialog also allows multiple filters to be set for a single column.
-   The actual data filtering is performed solely through the `igDataSource` control.
-   By default if no expression URL keys are set, an oData encoding is assumed – same as in the `igDataSource` filtering functionality.
-   The filter row can be navigated with the keyboard using TAB / SHIFT and TAB.
-   When the focus is on a filter dropdown, it can be opened with the ENTER key, and then filter dropdown items can be navigated with the UP and DOWN arrow keys.
-   Whenever some other grid feature triggers a “UI dirty” event (for example when the page size is changed when paging is enabled), filtering automatically clears all of the UI presets, if they are different than the defaults.
-   In order to have multiple filtering conditions configured for the same column, they should be added through the advanced filter dialog – when the filtering mode is set to advanced.
-   Whenever advanced filtering is used, and a column is chosen from the first column (in an advanced dialog filter row), the second column with the conditions is automatically updated depending on the column type. Therefore if the column is a numeric column, only numeric conditions are listed, and so on. Further the third column editor is updated, so if it is a date column, a date picker is rendered instead of a regular input element.
-   The `filterDelay` option combined with mode: “simple” can play an important role for making the end users’ work seamless. The greater the delay, the more time the end user can spend typing in the filter input before a filtering request is triggered.
-   It is very important to set the correct column types when filtering is used. If they are not configured properly, some unexpected errors and behaviors may occur, for example when setting a numeric column to be of type “string”, or the reverse.
-   Filtering can also be case sensitive, which can be turned on by setting the `caseSensitive` option to true. This options works only for local filtering.

You can get the current list of expression objects from the `dataFiltering` event arguments.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$(document).delegate("#grid1", "iggridfilteringdatafiltering", function (evt, ui) {
	var expressions = ui.expressions;
}
```

## <a id="enable"></a> Enabling Filtering

In order to get started with Filtering, you first need to include the necessary JavaScript and CSS dependencies. The easiest way to do that is to use the combined / minified version of the scripts and styles.

Listing 1: Necessary CSS and JavaScript references you need to include in your application

**In HTML:**

```html
<link type="text/css" href="infragistics.theme.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link type="text/css" href="infragistics.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.core.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.lob.js"></script>
```

Listing 2: Minimal set of CSS and JavaScript references (not minified and combined) – needed only for filtering



**In HTML:**

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.util.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.dataSource.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.ui.shared.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.ui.editors.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.ui.grid.framework.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="infragistics.ui.grid.filtering.js"></script>
```

Listing 3 shows sample code used to configure grid filtering.

Listing 3: Sample grid code for filtering

**In Javascript:**

```js
//Basic filtering on client
$("#myGrid").igGrid({
    dataSource: "/GetCensusData/",
    columns: [
        { headerText: "State", key: "StateName" },
        { headerText: "Congressional District", key: "CongressionalDistrict" },
        { headerText: "Population", key: "TotalPopulation" }
    ]
    features:[
        {
            name: "Filtering", 
            allowFiltering: true,
            caseSensitive: false,
            columnSettings: [
                {columnKey: "StateName", allowFiltering: false} 
            ]            
        }
    ]
});
```

Listing 4: Sample JSON response

**In Javascript:**

```js
[
   {"AverageFamilySize":3.36, "AverageHouseholdSize":2.91, "CongressionalDistrict":"14", "StateName": "Illinois", "TotalPopulation":720663},
   {"AverageFamilySize":3.00, "AverageHouseholdSize":2.43, "CongressionalDistrict":"15", "StateName": "Illinois", "TotalPopulation":595833},
   {"AverageFamilySize":3.16, "AverageHouseholdSize":2.67, "CongressionalDistrict":"16", "StateName": "Illinois", "TotalPopulation":691356}
]
```

Listing 5: HTML element required to instantiate the grid


**In HTML:**

```html
<div id="myGrid"></div>
```

Listing 6: ASPX or CSHTML markup for use with the ASP.NET MVC wrapper



**In ASPX:**

```csharp
<%= Html.Infragistics().Grid(Model).ID("grid1").PrimaryKey("ProductID").Height("400px").Columns(column =>
    {
        column.For(x => x.ProductID).HeaderText("Product ID").DataType("number");
        column.For(x => x.Name).HeaderText("Product Name");
        column.For(x => x.ModifiedDate).HeaderText("Modified Date");
        column.For(x => x.ListPrice).HeaderText("List Price");
    }).Features(features => {
        features.Filtering().Mode(FilterMode.Advanced);
    })
	.DataSourceUrl(Url.Action("GridGetData"))
	.DataBind()
	.Render()%>
```

## <a id="remote"></a> Remote Filtering
If filtering is configured to be remotely (ie: the type option is set to remote), the URL is automatically configured so that all filtering expressions are encoded automatically based on the end user actions (or based on the parameters passed, if programmatic filtering is performed). If no `filterExprUrlKey` is specified, oData URI conventions are automatically used in the encoding.

> **Note:** For more information regarding oData URI conventions, please visit: [http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/)

Otherwise, the grid encodes filtering information in the following way (example):

```
http://<SERVER>/grid/GridGetData? filter(Name)=startsWith(a)&filter(ModifiedDate)=today()&filterLogic=AND
```

When the ASP.NET MVC wrapper is used to bind to server-side data through LINQ (IQueryable), all filtering information that’s encoded in the URL is automatically translated to LINQ expression clauses (Where clause), so you do not need to do anything additional in order to filter the data.


## <a id="column-settings"></a> Column Settings

Each column setting can contain custom options that apply for a specific column, that is specified by the columnKey property. Table 1 shows all available properties that can be set in a single object that is part of the `columnSettings` option.

> **Note:** The `columnSettings` option is an array of objects listed in Table 1.

Table 1: igGridFiltering columnSettings

Property | Description
---|---
columnKey | Key of the column for which this column setting applies
allowFiltering | Whether filtering is enabled or disabled on the respective column. Default is true
condition | The default filtering condition that will be used for the column.


Listing 9: Example usage of columnSettings


**In Javascript:**

    $("#grid1").igGrid({
        columns: [
            { headerText: "Product ID", key: "ProductID", dataType: "number" },
            { headerText: "Product Name", key: "Name", dataType: "string" },
            { headerText: "Product Number", key: "ProductNumber", dataType: "string" },
        ],
        width: '500px',
        dataSource: products,
        features: [
            {
                name: 'Filtering',
                columnSettings: [
                    {columnKey: 'ProductID', condition: “startsWith” }
                ]
            }
        ]
    });

## <a id="client-side-events"></a> Client-Side events

You can bind to Filtering client-side events in two ways, which are described in Listing 10 and Listing 11, respectively. If you would like to bind using the approach described in Listing 10, you must use the jQuery `delegate()` method instead of bind if filtering is not yet instantiated.

Listing 10: Binding to client-side events from anywhere in your application


**In Javascript:**

    $("#grid1").bind("iggridfilteringdatafiltered", handler);

Listing 11: Binding to client-side events by specifying the event name as an option when you initialize the filtering feature (case sensitive)

**In Javascript:**

    $(function () {
        $("#grid1").igGrid({
            columns: [
                { headerText: "Product ID", key: "ProductID", dataType: "number" },
                { headerText: "Product Name", key: "Name", dataType: "string" },
                { headerText: "Product Number", key: "ProductNumber", dataType: "string" },
            ],
            width: '500px',
            dataSource: products,
            features: [
                {
                    name: 'Filtering',
                    dataFiltering: handler
                }
            ]
        });
    });

    //Handler code
    function handler(event, args) {

    }

> **Note:** All ‘ing’ events are cancellable. In order to cancel an ‘ing’ event, its respective event handler must return false.

## <a id="api"></a> API Usage

In order to filter the grid programmatically, you need to call the filter() function on the `igGridFiltering` widget. The filter function is defined in the following way:

```
filter(expressions, updateUI)
```


The expressions argument is an array of expression objects. Listing 12 gives an overview of the structure of each expression object. The updateUI argument is optional and it can be set explicitly to false so that the UI is not updated when the grid is filtered programmatically.

Listing 12: Filtering expression object structure

**In Javascript:**

```js
{expr: <filter expression string>, cond: <filtering condition>, fieldName: <name of column key>}
```

Listing 7 and Listing 8 show examples of using the filter() function off the `igGridFiltering` widget.

Listing 7: Filter by ProductID = 1

**In Javascript:**

```js
$("#grid1").igGridFiltering('filter', ([{ fieldName: "ProductID", expr: 1, cond: "equals"}]));
```

Listing 8: Filter by ProductID = 1 and ProductName startsWith “a”:

**In Javascript:**
```js
$("#grid1").igGridFiltering('filter', ([{ fieldName: "ProductID", expr: 1, cond: "equals"}, {fieldName: "ProductName", expr: "a", cond: "startsWith"} ]));
```

The following conditions are available to perform filtering on the grid:

-   startsWith
-   endsWith
-   greaterThan
-   lessThan
-   equals
-   doesNotEqual
-   contains
-   greaterThanOrEqualTo
-   lessThanOrEqualTo
-   null
-   notNull
-   empty
-   notEmpty
-   on
-   notOn
-   today
-   yesterday
-   lastMonth
-   nextMonth
-   thisMonth
-   last year
-   this year
-   tomorrow
-   true
-   false

## <a id="properties"></a> List of Filtering Options (Properties)

Option and default value shows in brackets

Option and default value shows in brackets | Description
---|---
caseSensitive (false) | Enables / disables case sensitive filtering (boolean). This options works only for local filtering.
filterSummaryAlwaysVisible (true) | By default, once filtering is performed, a summary label will appear in the footer area of the grid stating how many matches have been found. When paging is enabled, the filter summary replaces the area on the left which denotes how many records are shown. When the page is changed, respectively, the filter summary is replaced with the paging label.
filterSummaryTemplate (${matches} matching records) | Template for the filter summary label
filterDropDownAnimations (“linear”) | Accepted values are “linear” and “none”
filterDropDownAnimationDuration (500) | Duration of the animations when filterDropDownAnimations is set to “linear”
filterDropDownWidth (0) | Default width of the filter dropdown width. When set to 0, the width will grow with contents automatically
filterDropDownHeight (0) | Same as filterDropDownWidth but for height
filterExprUrlKey (null) | Expression key to encode in the URL when remote filtering is performed. Default value of null assumes oData URI Conventions will be used ([documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/))
filterDropDownItemIcons (true) | Small image icons for the filtering conditions will be rendered in front of every dropdown item if this option is enabled – it is enabled by default.
columnSettings ([]) | A list of custom column settings for filtering conditions. The format of each column settings object in the list is described below.
type (“remote”) | Type of the filtering operations. Can be remote or local. The local setting implies filtering is performed on the currently bound data in the data source.
filterDelay (500) | Delay before filtering is triggered. As the end user is typing, most of the times we don’t want a filtering request after every keystroke, so this is the delay that starts after every keystroke, and is cancelled if the time between the previous and the potential next keystroke (if any) exceeds this value.
mode (“simple”) | Simple filtering renders a filter row below the grid’s headers, where each column has a dedicated editor and button (optional) that is always visible. “advanced” filtering renders a button in the header which, after clicked, opens up the advanced filtering dialog where multiple conditions can be configured (even more than 1 conditions per column)
advancedModeEditorsVisible (false) | When this option is set to true, dedicated filtering editors are still rendered for every column header, even though the filter mode is Advanced. The advanced filtering dialog can be accessed from the “Advanced” button located at the end of every column filter dropdown.
advancedModeHeaderButtonLocation (“left”) | When the filtering mode is Advanced, and advancedModeEditorsVisible is false, the advanced button is renderd in the header next to the header text, so this property controls if it will be rendered before the header text or after it. If there is sorting enabled, and a column is sorted, the sorting indicator gets rendered always to the right of anything else.
filterDialogWidth (350) | Width of the advanced filtering dialog (if applicable)
filterDialogHeight (‘’) | Height of the advanced filtering dialog (if applicable). By default no height is set to that it grows with the contents.
filterDialogFilterDropDownDefaultWidth (80) | This is the default width of every dropdown Filter Condition added in the advanced filtering. That’s the second dropdown in every filter row, which is also a plain HTML SELECT element, and lets the end user choose from the filtering conditions list.
filterDialogExprInputDefaultWidth (80) | This is the default width for every filter expression input which is added as the last box of every filter row in the advanced filtering dialog.
filterDialogColumnDropDownDefaultWidth (null) | This is the default width of every dropdown column filter added in the advanced filtering. That’s the first dropdown in every filter row, which is also an igEditor, and lets the end user choose from the columns list.
renderFilterButton (true) | Enables / disables rendering of the filter dropdown button in every filter row cell. If this is set to false, it means the end user can only use the predefined filter and enter text in the input.
filterButtonLocation (“left”) | Location of the filter dropdown button. Can be “left” or “right”.
tooltipTemplate ("${condition} filter applied") | Tooltip template that will appear when the end user hovers over the filtering dropdown button
filterDialogAddButtonWidth (100) | Width of the “Add” button in the advanced filter dialog
filterDialogOkCancelButtonWidth (100) | Width of the Ok and Cancel buttons in the advanced filter dialog
filterDialogMaxFilterCount (5) | Maximum number of filters that can be added in the advanced filtering dialog. If this number is exceeded, a validation error message will appear.
featureChooserText ("Hide Filter") | Feature chooser text when filter is shown and filter mode is simple.
featureChooserTextHide ("Show Filter") | Feature chooser text when filter is hidden and filter mode is simple.
featureChooserTextAdvancedFilter ("Advanced Filter") | Feature chooser text when filter mode is advanced.

## <a id="keyboard-interaction"></a> Keyboard Interactions

When _simple_ filtering mode is enabled the following keyboard interactions are available.

When focus is on the grid:

-	TAB: Can move focus between the focusable elements of the filtering UI: filtering buttons and editors.
When focus is on the filtering button:
-	ENTER/SPACE: Opens the filtering conditions drop down. You can then navigate the available items in the drop down with the UP/DOWN keys.
-	UP/DOWN:  Changes the active filtering condition for the cell.
-	TAB: Moves focus to the filtering editor element.

When _advanced_ filtering mode is enabled the following keyboard interactions are available.

When focus is on the grid:
-	TAB: Moves focus to the first filter button.
When focus is on the filter buttons:
-	ENTER: Opens the advanced filter dialog.
-	TAB: Moves focus to the next filter button or the next focusable element on the page.

When focus is on the advanced filter dialog:

-	TAB: Moves focus between the elements of the dialog.
-	ESCAPE: Closes the dialog.

_Note_: There is a difference between the drop-down for selecting the column and the condition drop-down. One is an igCombo, the other a standard < select > element. The < select > element opens on SPACE/ENTER and its content can be navigated with the UP/DOWN keys and selected with ENTER. The igCombo cannot be opened with enter/space. Its values can be changed directly using the UP/DOWN keys.

- Behavioral changes

|Old behavior|New behavior|
