## Topic Overview

### Purpose

This topic explains how to attach events in jQuery and MVC and provides a reference about the events that are specific to column management.

## <a id="events-overview"></a> Events Overview

There are a couple of events related to column management. (See the Events Reference Chart below).

Also, all events with the **-ing** suffix are cancelable and the action can be terminated when in the handler is set to return false.

**In Javascript:**

```js
$("#grid1").igGrid({
   features: [
	{
		name: 'Hiding',
		columnHiding: function (ui, args) {
			return  false;
		}
    }
  ]
});
```

Most of the argument methods and properties contain row-specific data and an identification of the grid they belong to.

## <a id="attaching-events"></a> Attaching to Events in jQuery and MVC

To attach to an event, the only thing you need to define is a handler for it, just like you define a property. Then when the event is triggered, the handler will be called.

**In Javascript:**

```js
$("#grid1").igGrid({
    features: [{
        name: 'Hiding',
        columnHiding: function (e, args) {
            // Handle event  
        }
    }]
});
```

When attaching a handler in MVC, you need to use the jQuery User Interface (UI) pattern, which mandates concatenating the name of the control and event in lower-case letters.

**In Javascript:**

```js
$("#grid1").live("iggridhidingcolumnhiding ", function (e, args) {
     // Handle event  
});
```

> **Note**: The jQuery’s `live` function is used in case some DOM elements are added after attaching to the handler.
