## <a id="UnboundValues-pk"></a> Populating unbound columns in the View with chaining using the primary key (Code Example)

### <a id="UnboundValues-description"></a> Description

This example uses the `Grid<T>.SetUnboundValues(string key, Dictionary<object, object> values)` method to set unbound column data.

This overload accepts two parameters: “Column key” and a Dictionary of `<PrimaryKey, Unbound Value>` pairs. The `PrimaryKey` in the dictionary points to a primary key of a row in the `igGrid` and the “Unbound Value” is the value that is set in the unbound column whose key is equal to “Column key.”

> **Note:** Only use this overload after defining a primary key.

When using the `SetUnboundValues` and `MergeUnboundColumns = TRUE`, the unbound values are added to the bound data after performing any paging, sorting, filtering, etc. operations because there is a clearly defined correlation between a row identifier and unbound value meaning that there is no need to take additional actions when paging/sorting/filtering are remote.

### <a id="UnboundValues-code"></a> Code

Model:

**In C#:**

```csharp
namespace UnboundColumns.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int ProductID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string ProductNumber { get; set; }
        public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This is a very simple Product model which contains four fields.

View:

**In C#:**

```csharp
@using Infragistics.Web.Mvc
@model IQueryable<UnboundColumns.Models.Product>
@(Html.Infragistics()
.Grid(Model)
.ID("grid1")
.PrimaryKey("ProductID")
.AutoGenerateColumns(false)
.Columns(col =>
{
    col.For(c => c.ProductID).HeaderText("Product ID");
    col.Unbound("InStock")
        .HeaderText("In Stock")
        .DataType("bool");
})
.MergeUnboundColumns(true)
.SetUnboundValues("InStock", (Dictionary<object, object>)ViewData["ProductsInStock"])
.DataBind()
.Render())
```

The View is very simple. It has a strongly typed model `IQueryable<UnboundColumns.Models.Product>`. This is the model used by the Grid MVC wrapper to bind to data. Grid is configured with one unbound column with key `InStock` which is bound to data by a call to `Grid<T>.SetUnboundValues(string columnKey, List<object> unboundValues)`. The code defines the primary key so that the Grid Wrapper matches the unbound values with the grid data by primary key.

Controller:

**In C#:**

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        Dictionary<object, object> productsInStock =
        new Dictionary<object, object>();
        productsInStock.Add(1, true);
        productsInStock.Add(2, false);
        productsInStock.Add(3, false);
        ViewData["ProductsInStock"] = productsInStock;
        return View(this.GetProducts().AsQueryable());
    }
    private List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
        List<Product> products = new List<Product>()
        {
            new Product() { ProductID = 1, Name = "Adjustable Race", ProductNumber = "AR-5381" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 2, Name = "Bearing Ball", ProductNumber = "BA-8327" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 3, Name = "BB Ball Bearing", ProductNumber = "BE-2349" }
        };
        return products;
    }
}
```

The Controller contains two methods. `GetProducts` is a private method which returns a sample list of products. `Index` action method constructs the unbound values dictionary instance called `productsInStock` and saves it in the `ViewData` variable with key `ProductsInStock`. Finally `GetProducts` result is passed to the View.



## <a id="UnboundValues-without-pk"></a> Populating unbound column in the View with chaining without using the primary key (Code Example)

### Description

This overload accepts a Column Key and List of values as parameters. The values from the list are set in the column’s cells with the specified “Column Key.” Will throw a custom exception if you failed to provide an unbound column with the specified key or the key is of bound column.

Use this method if a primary key is undefined.

If there is a defined primary key, we recommend you to use the overload `GridModel.SetUnboundValues(string key, Dictionary<object, object> values)`. Using the list in this case negatively affects performance because the whole data source is traversed in order to create a correlation between the row identifier and the list items. Make the relationship according the order of the items in the unbound list of values.

It sets as many values as the list contains. If the number of the rows is greater than the list’s length, than the remaining rows are not filled.

> **Note:** The use of `Grid<T>.SetUnboundValues (<Column key>, <List of values>)` overload without a defined primary key results in no mapping existing between the primary key, or some other row identifier, and the unbound values. Consider this when using remote filtering, sorting or paging.

When using `SetUnboundValues` and `MergeUnboundColumns = “true”`, adds the unbound values to the bound data after performing any paging, sorting, filtering, etc. operations.

### Code

Model:

**In C#:**

```csharp
namespace UnboundColumns.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int ProductID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string ProductNumber { get; set; }
        public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This is a very simple Product model which contains four fields.

Controller:

**In C#:**

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        List<object> productsInStock =
        new List<object>();
        productsInStock.Add(true);
        productsInStock.Add(false);
        productsInStock.Add(false);
        ViewData["InStock"] = productsInStock;
        return View(this.GetProducts().AsQueryable());
    } 
    private List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
        List<Product> products = new List<Product>()
        {
            new Product() { ProductID = 1, Name = "Adjustable Race", ProductNumber = "AR-5381" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 2, Name = "Bearing Ball", ProductNumber = "BA-8327" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 3, Name = "BB Ball Bearing", ProductNumber = "BE-2349" }
        };
        return products;
    }
}
```

The Controller contains two methods. `GetProducts` is a private method that returns a sample list of products, while the public `Index` action method creates a list of objects used by the unbound column. This list is saved in the `ViewData` variable called `InStock`. Finally, the `Index` action method passes the product’s data to the view.

View:

**In C#:**

```csharp
@using Infragistics.Web.Mvc
@model IQueryable<UnboundColumns.Models.Product>
@(Html.Infragistics()
.Grid(Model)
.ID("grid1")
.AutoGenerateColumns(false)
.Columns(col =>
{
    col.Unbound("InStock")
        .HeaderText("In Stock")
        .DataType("bool");
})
.SetUnboundValues("InStock", (List<object>)ViewData["InStock"])
.DataBind()
.Render())
```

The strongly typed View is with model `IQueryable<UnboundColumns.Models.Product>`. The Grid MVC wrapper uses this model to bind to data. The code configures the grid with one unbound column with key `InStock` bound to data by a call to `UnboundColumnWrapper<T>.UnboundValues(List<object> list)`.



## <a id="primary-key"></a> Populating unbound column in the Controller by using the primary key (Code Example)

### <a id="primary-key-description"></a> Description

This example uses the `GridModel.SetUnboundValues(string key, Dictionary<object, object> values)` method to set unbound column data.

This overload accepts two parameters: “Column key” and a Dictionary of
`<PrimaryKey, Unbound Value>` pairs. The PrimaryKey in the dictionary points to a primary key of a row in the `igGrid` and the “Unbound Value” is the value which is set in the unbound column with key equal to “Column key.”

> **Note:** Only Use this overload when a primary key is defined

When using the `SetUnboundValues` and `MergeUnboundColumns = TRUE`, it adds the unbound values to the bound data after performing any paging, sorting, filtering, etc. operations because there is a clearly defined correlation between a row identifier and unbound value meaning that there is no need to take additional actions when remotely paging/sorting/filtering.

### <a id="primary-key-code"></a> Code

Model:

**In C#:**

```csharp
namespace UnboundColumns.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int ProductID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string ProductNumber { get; set; }
        public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This is a very simple Product model containing four fields.

View:

**In C#:**

```csharp
@using Infragistics.Web.Mvc
@model GridModel
@Html.Infragistics().Grid(Model)
```

The View is very simple with a strongly typed `GridModel` model used to configure the grid in the Controller.

Controller:

**In C#:**

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        GridModel gridModel = GetGridModel();
        return View(gridModel);
    }
    private GridModel GetGridModel()
    {
        GridModel gridModel = new GridModel();
        gridModel.DataSource = this.GetProducts().AsQueryable();
        gridModel.PrimaryKey = "ProductID";
        gridModel.AutoGenerateColumns = false;
        gridModel.MergeUnboundColumns = true;
        gridModel.Columns.Add(new GridColumn()
        {
            Key = "ProductID",
            HeaderText = "Product ID"
        });
        gridModel.Columns.Add(new UnboundColumn()
        {
            Key = "InStock",
            HeaderText = "In Stock"
        });
        Dictionary<object, object> productsInStock =
        new Dictionary<object, object>();
        productsInStock.Add(1, true);
        productsInStock.Add(2, false);
        productsInStock.Add(3, false);
        gridModel.SetUnboundValues("InStock", productsInStock);
        return gridModel;
    }
    private List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
        List<Product> products = new List<Product>()
        {
            new Product() { ProductID = 1, Name = "Adjustable Race", ProductNumber = "AR-5381" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 2, Name = "Bearing Ball", ProductNumber = "BA-8327" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 3, Name = "BB Ball Bearing", ProductNumber = "BE-2349" }
        };
        return products;
    }
}
```

The Controller contains three methods. `GetProducts` is a private method that returns a sample list of products. `Index` action method calls `GetGridModel` method and passes its result to the View. The `GetGridModel` method configures the grid using the `GridModel` class. Note that the `PrimaryKey` property is set. This is mandatory if you want to use this `SetUnboundValues` method overload. In the end of the method a new `Dictionary<object, object>` is created and populated and a call to `GridModel.SetUnboundValues` is made (Usually you will populate the values from another data source or calculate them on the fly).



## <a id="without-primary-key"></a> Populating unbound column in the Controller without using the primary key (Code Example)

### <a id="without-primary-key-description"></a> Description

This overload accepts a Column Key and List of values as parameters. The values from the list are set in the cells of the column with the specified “Column Key”. A custom exception is thrown if there is not an unbound column with the specified key or the key is of bound column.

Use this method even if a primary key is undefined.

If there is a primary key defined, we recommend you to use the overload `GridModel.SetUnboundValues(string key, Dictionary<object, object> values)`. Using the list in this case negatively affects performance because the whole data source is traversed in order to create a correlation between the row identifier and the list items. Make this relation according to the order of the items in the unbound list of values.

It sets as many values as the list contains. If the number of the rows
is greater than the list’s length, than the remaining rows are not
filled.

> **Note:** If you do not assign a primary key and you are using the `GridModel.SetUnboundValues (<Column key>, < List of values >)` overload results in no mapping between the primary key (or some other row identifier) and unbound values. This should be taken into account when using remote Filtering, Sorting, Paging

When using `SetUnboundValues` and `MergeUnboundColumns = “true”`, the unbound values are added to the bound data after performing any paging, sorting, filtering, etc. operations.

### <a id="without-primary-key-code"></a> Code

Model:

**In C#:**

```csharp
namespace UnboundColumns.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int ProductID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string ProductNumber { get; set; }
        public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This is a very simple Product model which contains four fields.

View:

**In C#:**

```csharp
@using Infragistics.Web.Mvc

@Html.Infragistics().Grid(Model)
```

        GridModel gridModel = GetGridModel();
        return View(gridModel);
    }
    private GridModel GetGridModel()
    {
        GridModel gridModel = new GridModel();
        gridModel.DataSource = this.GetProducts().AsQueryable();
        gridModel.AutoGenerateColumns = false;
        gridModel.MergeUnboundColumns = true;
        gridModel.Columns.Add(new UnboundColumn()
        {
            Key = "InStock",
            HeaderText = "In Stock"
        });
        List<object> productsInStock =
        new List<object>();
        productsInStock.Add(true);
        productsInStock.Add(false);
        productsInStock.Add(false);
        gridModel.SetUnboundValues("InStock", productsInStock);
        return gridModel;
    }
    private List<Product> GetProducts()
    {
        List<Product> products = new List<Product>()
        {
            new Product() { ProductID = 1, Name = "Adjustable Race", ProductNumber = "AR-5381" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 2, Name = "Bearing Ball", ProductNumber = "BA-8327" },
            new Product() { ProductID = 3, Name = "BB Ball Bearing", ProductNumber = "BE-2349" }
        };
        return products;
    }
}

Public Index action method calls the `GetGridModel` method and passes its result to the View. The `GetGridModel` method configures the grid using the `GridModel` class. Note that the `PrimaryKey` property is not set. In the end the method creates and populates a new `List<object>` and makes a call to the `GridModel.SetUnboundValues` (Usually you will populate the values from another data source or calculate them on the fly).
