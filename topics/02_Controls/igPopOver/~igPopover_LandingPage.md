## In This Group of Topics

### Introduction

The `igPopover`™ control is a pop-up window functioning as a browser tooltip: it dispays over a DOM element that provides context information about it.

The `igPopover` control is designed to be used as an enhanced replacement of browser tooltips and cannot work as a standalone window. Its content and display are dependent on the target element on which it is initialized.
