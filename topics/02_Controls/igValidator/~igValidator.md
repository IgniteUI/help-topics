# igValidator

 
The `igValidator` control provides new look and feel compared to the previous one. It is designed to be easy to use with any form element and our existing components such as editors, combo box and other components for collecting user input. This control takes advantage to the notification widget design and use its visualizations to display the necessary warning and error messages.
