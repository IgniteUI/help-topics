# igSpreadsheet Accessibility Compliance

All of the %%ProductName%%â„¢ controls and components comply with Section 508, Subpart 1194.22 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Table 1 contains the specific rules of Subpart 1194.22 that pertain to the control. Also detailed is how the `igSpreadsheet` control complies with each rule.

To meet the requirements each accessibility rule, in some cases, you may need to interact with the control by to setting a specific property, but in other cases the control does the work for you.

> **Note:** As jQuery controls are client-only, some of the rules are not supported and are marked as limitations.
