# igTreeGrid


### Introduction

The `igTreeGrid` control is a jQuery widget that displays data in a
tree-like tabular structure. The control presents hierarchical data
similar to the `igHierarchicalGrid` control. Child layouts in `igTreeGrid`
have the same column definition as the root layout. Rendering hierarchal
data all with the same columns allows the tree grid to have superior
render speeds while maintaining low memory and low DOM footprints.
Further, the `igTreeGrid` also supports advanced interactive features that
operate in the same way as the `igGrid`.
