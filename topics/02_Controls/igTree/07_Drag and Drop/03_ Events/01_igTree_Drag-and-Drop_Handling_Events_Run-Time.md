# Handling Drag-and-Drop Events Run-Time (igTree)

## Topic Overview
### Purpose

This topic explains, with a code example, how to subscribe to events in the `igTree`™ control and attach event handlers at run-time.

### Required background

The following topics are prerequisites to understanding this topic:

- [Drag-and-Drop Overview (igTree)](igTree-Drag-and-Drop-Overview.html): This topic provides an overview the Drag-and-Drop feature of the `igTree` control.



## Attaching Event Handlers in an igTree at Run-Time
#### Attaching event handlers at run-time summary

When using the MVC helper, it is necessary to assign event handlers at run-time because you cannot define event handlers within the MVC helper.

jQuery supports the following methods for assigning event handlers:

-  ` bind()`
-   `delegate()`
-   `live()`
-   `on()`

From these, the delegate() method is the recommended one because it offers the best performance and allows the event handler to be automatically re-attached if the control instance is destroyed and then re-created.

### Code Example

The code in this example assigns an event handler at run-time.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$(document).delegate(".selector", "igtreedragstart", function(evt, ui) { 
    // Handle event
});
```
