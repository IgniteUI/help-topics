# Using Themes with igTree

## Using Themes
### Introduction
The `igTree`™ control uses the jQuery UI CSS Framework for styling and theming. By default, the `igTree` control uses the IG Theme which is a jQuery UI theme provided by Infragistics for use in your applications.

To customize a theme, you can use the jQuery UI ThemeRoller. ThemeRoller is a tool provided by jQuery UI which aids in the creation of custom themes that are compatible with jQuery UI widgets. Many pre-built themes are available for download and use in your website. The `igTree` control supports the use of ThemeRoller themes.
