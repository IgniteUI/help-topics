# Accessibility Compliance (igScroll)



## Scroll Accessibility Compliance
All of the %%ProductName%%™ controls and components comply with Section 508, Subpart 1194.22 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. **Table 1** contains the specific rules of Subpart 1194.22 that pertain to the control. Also detailed is how the control complies with each rule.

To meet the requirements each accessibility rule, in some cases, you may need to interact with the control by to setting a specific property, but in other cases the control does the work for you.

>**Note:** As jQuery controls are client-only, some of the rules are not supported and are marked as limitations.
