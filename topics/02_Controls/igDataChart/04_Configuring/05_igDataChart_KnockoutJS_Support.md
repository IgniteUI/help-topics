##Introduction

### Knockout support summary

The support for the Knockout library in the `igDataChart` control is intended to make it easier for developers to use the Knockout library and its declarative syntax to instantiate and configure chart controls.

Implementing Knockout support as a Knockout extension, initially invoked when applying Knockout bindings to a page and throughout the page’s life whenever external updates to the View-Model occur.

To instantiate a chart control bound to a Knockout managed data structure you need to specify `igDataChart` configuration options into data-bind attribute of an HTML div or span element. The chart renders at the location of the HTML tag just like if you create the control using JavaScript. Additional information on its more commonly used options please refer to the [](#Configuring_igDataChart)[Configuring `igDataChart` with Knockout Support](#Configuring_igDataChart) section. You can also specify all of the other igDataChart options in the data-bind attribute that are relevant to your business case.

>**Note:** The knockout support is only valid from the View-Model to the View
- in our case the `igDataChart` control. Updates to the View-Model, in our case passed as dataSource property to the `igDataChart`, notify the `igDataChart` UI, and animates the rendering of the new value. Using the API methods to edit the `igDataChart` will not update the View-Model. It is impossible to update the `igDataChart` from the View as it lives inside HTML Canvas element.

>**Note:** The knockout extension for `igDataChart` adds a hidden HTML div element to the browser DOM tree containing the UL list. This is necessary because the chart is a single HTML Canvas element, but the binding handlers of each of the chart items requires additional DOM element, in this case its HTML LI. Keep this in mind when visualizing significantly large data sets.

##<a id="Code_Example_igDataChart"></a>Code Example: Configure igDataChart for Editing, Adding and Deleting an Item


### Description

This example shows how to instantiate an `igDataChart` control and bind it to a data structure managed by Knockout. Using the declarative syntax of Knockout, instantiate the chart from the data-bind attribute of a div element and bind to the View-Model observable properties.

### Code

The code snippet below shows a View-Model object that has observable flat structure and properties managed by Knockout. In this example, explicitly declaring the data structure is for clarity; however, in a real-world case with a remote data source (*i.e.**,* database) providing the data the data will be in the form of a JSON. The data then can be made observable by using the Knockout Mapping library.

>**Note:** Both the array structures and individual object fields are declared as observable. Hence it will be able to update the View when a data item is added, removed or changed, or it can change the View-Model when the user makes edits.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
var viewModel = {
    data: ko.observableArray(
        [{
            label: ko.observable("I"),
            value1: ko.observable(90.34),
            value2: ko.observable(15.77),
            value3: ko.observable(10.09)
        }, {
            label: ko.observable("II"),
            value1: ko.observable(45.11),
            value2: ko.observable(80.12),
            value3: ko.observable(9.89)
        }, {
        . . .
        }];
    );
}
```

The following code snippet shows how to apply the declared Knockout bindings to the page.

>**Note:** The `ko.applyBindings()` call is made within the Loader’s ready callback. This is necessary because the chart extension for Knockout needs to be loaded into the page before the bindings are applied.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$.ig.loader({
    scriptPath: "http://localhost/ig_ui/js/",
    cssPath: "http://localhost/ig_ui/css/",
    resources: "igDataChart,extensions/infragistics.ui.datachart.knockout-extensions.js",
    ready: function () {
        ko.applyBindings(viewModel);
    }
});
```

The following code snippet demonstrates how to declare binding options in your View, for a chart control that you want to consist of three different line series. The most important part is the declaration of the instantiation options in the data-bind attribute of the div element.

**In HTML:**

```html
<div data-bind="igDataChart: {
      dataSource: data,
      axes: [{
            name: "xAxis",
            type: "categoryX",
            label: "label",
      }, {
            name: "yAxis",
            type: "numericY",
      }],
      series: [{
            name: "line1",
            type: "line",
            markerType: "automatic",
            xAxis: "xAxis",
            yAxis: "yAxis",
            valueMemberPath: "value1"
      }, {
            name: "line2",
            type: "line",
            markerType: "automatic",
            xAxis: "xAxis",
            yAxis: "yAxis",
            valueMemberPath: "value2"
      }, {
            name: "line3",
            type: "line",
            markerType: "automatic",
            xAxis: "xAxis",
            yAxis: "yAxis",
            valueMemberPath: "value3"
      }] }"></div>
```

When the control is bound to the View-Model through Knockout it will receive notifications of any changes.

The control can be bound to a non-observable array and object fields, but doing so will cause you to lose the updating functionality making such a scenario pointless to use in the context of KnockoutJS.
