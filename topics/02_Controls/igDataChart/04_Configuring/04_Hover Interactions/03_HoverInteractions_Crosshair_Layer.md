# Configuring the Crosshair Layer (igDataChart)


## Topic Overview

### Purpose


This topic provides information about the crosshair layer used for hover interactions. It describes the properties of the crosshair layer and provides an implementation example.

### Required background

The following topics are prerequisites to understanding this topic:

- [Adding igDataChart](igDataChart-Adding.html): This topic demonstrates how to add the `igDataChart`™ control to a page and bind it to data.

- [Binding igDataChart to Data](igDataChart-DataBinding.html): This topic explains how to bind the `igDataChart`™ control to various data sources (JavaScript array, `IQueryable<T>`, web service).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

#### Crosshair layer overview

The `crosshairLayer` renders as crossing lines intersecting at the actual value of every series that they are configured to target with each series rendering a separate set of lines.

You can configure the `crosshairLayer` so that the layer will only display one specific series as by default they target all series on the `igDataChart` control. To achieve this, set the `targetSeries` property. For more information on this property, see the [Properties](#properties) section below.

By default, the color of the crosshair lines is a lighter color than the series that it is interacting with. However, this default setting can be overridden so that you can select a color that will be used for the crosshair lines. This is done by setting the `brush` property. For more information on this property see the [Hover Interactions Property Reference (igDataChart)](HoverInteractions-Common-Properties.html) topic.

#### <a id="preview"></a> Preview

The following image is a preview of the `igDataChart` control rendered with the `crosshairLayer` added.

## <a id="properties"></a> Properties

#### Crosshair layer properties

The following table summarizes the properties of the crosshair layer.

Property Name | Property Type | Description
---|---|---
horizontalLineVisibility | visibility | This property specifies if the horizontal line of the crosshair layer should be visible. If this is set to `collapsed`, only the vertical line will display.
verticalLineVisibilty | visibility | This property specifies if the vertical line of the crosshair layer should be visible. If this is set to `collapsed`, only the horizontal line will display.
targetSeries | series | This property specifies which series should have an enabled crosshair layer. It is possible to create a separate crosshair layer for each series and configure them individually.
useInterpolation | bool | This property specifies if the vertical crosshair should cross the series at an interpolated position between data points. Usually the crosshair layer finds the closest point in a series and ensures that the crosshairs meet at that point, however if the points are sparse then you should enable this property.
isAxisAnnotationEnabled | bool | This property specifies if the crosshair value will render in an annotation label in the axes.

## <a id="annotations"></a>Axis Annotations

The Crosshair Layer can display the value of the crosshair on the related axis.  That is, the horizontal crosshair value shows on Y-axis and the vertical crosshair value shows on X-axis.  This can be enabled by setting the `isAxisAnnotationEnabled` property to true.

#### Styling Annotations

The axis annotations can be styled with the following properties:

Property Name | Property Type | Description
---|---|---
xAxisAnnotationBackground<br/>yAxisAnnotationBackground | string | The background color of the annotation.
xAxisAnnotationTextColor<br/>yAxisAnnotationTextColor | string | The color of the text in the annotation.
xAxisAnnotationOutline<br/>yAxisAnnotationOutline | string | The color of the annotation's outline.
xAxisAnnotationStrokeThickness<br/>yAxisAnnotationStrokeThickness | number | The thickness of the annotation's outline.

## <a id="example"></a> Example

This sample demonstrates the Crosshair Layer that provides crossing lines that meet at the actual value of every series that they are targeting.
The sample options pane allows you to edit the properties of the layer, such as changing the thickness of the crosshair.
