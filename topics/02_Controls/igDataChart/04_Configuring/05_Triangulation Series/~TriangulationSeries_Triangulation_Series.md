# Configuring Triangulation Series (igDataChart)

## In This Group of Topics

### Introduction

The topics in this group explain both the Scatter Area and Scatter Contour series.  Both series take a list of points containing three values (X, Y and Z) and triangulate these points using the X and Y values in order to generate a two-dimensional surface that is rendered on screen.  The Z value is used for coloring the surface using a color scale.  This allows an easy visualization of value changes across a two-dimensional space.  An example might be displaying wifi strength across different locations in an office.
