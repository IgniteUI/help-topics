##<a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

###igMap summary

The `igMap` control is intended to facilitate drawing maps with custom overlays in HTML5 web applications and sites. It uses the **Canvas** tag in HTML5 to plot the actual maps and visualize data on the maps.

![](images/Overview_%28igMap%29_1.png)

Maps rendered by the `igMap` control consist of a background content (the actual geographic map) delivered by a map provider (like Bing® Maps, CloudMade, or OpenStreetMap maps) and an overlay which represents the actual custom data you wish to visualize for the user. There are several types of overlays you can render on a map called “map series” or “map types” (see [Supported Map Types](#supported-map-types)).

A map can have an Overview Plus Detail (OPD) panel which serves the user to navigate and to give understanding about the exact location on the world map. The map supports user interactions like panning and zooming with keyboard, with keyboard and mouse actions, or by touch and drag action on touch-enabled devices. For details, see the [Main Features Summary](#main-features) section.



##<a id="supported-map-types"></a>Supported Map Types

### <a id="map-types-summary"></a>Supported map types summary

The `igMap` control allows for a variety of series types to be implemented for different visualization purposes. The series are managed by setting `igMap`’s `series.type` property and its respective data binding properties.

See the [](#map-types-table)[Supported map types table](#map-types-table) block for detailed information on supported series types and basic configuration information.

### <a id="map-types-table"></a>Supported map types table

The following table displays the supported map (series) types.

##<a id="min-requirements"></a>Minimum Requirements

### <a id="min-introduction"></a>Introduction

The `igMap` control is a jQuery UI widget and depends on the jQuery and jQuery UI libraries. The Modernzr library is used internally for detecting browser and device capabilities. The control uses shared resources from the Ignite UI™ for functionality and data binding. References to these resources are needed nevertheless, in spite of pure jQuery or ASP.NET MVC helpers being used. The `Infragistics.Web.Mvc` assembly is required when the control is used in the context of ASP.NET MVC.

### <a id="min-requirements-summary"></a>Requirements summary chart

The following table summarizes the requirements for `igMap` control.

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="table">

			<td>
				HTML5 canvas API
			</td>

            <td>
The functionality of the igMap control is based on the HTML5 Canvas tag and its related API. Any web browser that supports these will be able to render and display maps generated by the control. No other HTML5 features are required for the operation of the igMap control. The topic [Canvas Element: Support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element#Support) from [Wikipedia™](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) details which versions of the most popular desktop and mobile web browsers support the HTML5 Canvas API.

##<a id="main-features"></a>Main Features Summary


### <a id="main-features-chart"></a>Main features summary chart

The following table summarizes the main features of the `igMap` control. Additional details are available after following the summary table.

Feature|Description
---|---
[Support for different map providers](#different-map-providers)|The map providers  deliver the map images and the map series are plotted as overlays over this background content. Any geographic series can be plotted on any background content.
[Support for different map types (series)](#map-types-summary)|The `igMap` control can visualize different map series. The series type is determined by the type option of each series object. Depending on the map series type, different kinds of input data must be supplied and correspondingly  different data binding options must be set.
[Zooming](#zooming)|Zooming is part of the user interaction features of the `igMap` control. It allows details for a specific map area to be revealed or a larger scale view to be displayed. Zooming can also be performed programmatically using the control’s API.
[Panning](#panning)|Panning is part of the user interaction features of the `igMap` control. It allows the currently displayed window from the map to be moved to the North, South, East, or West. Panning can also be performed programmatically using the control’s API.
[Tooltips](#tooltips)|Tooltips can be displayed when hovering over a marker or shape area of the map. Tooltips are based on templates which can render custom HTML markup and display data about a particular area of the map.
[Customizable markers](#customizable-markers)|Different markers can be used to designate points from the map. There are a plenty of built-in shapes like circle, triangle, diamond or others. Apart from the built-in markers, you have the option to create a custom marker by drawing directly on the canvas element.
[Customizable look-and-fill of the series](#customizable-appearance)|The visual components of the series, like outlines, shapes, and fills, can be  configured in terms of line thickness and patterns, color, color gradient, opacity, and so on. The exact customizations that can be applied are  specific for each series type.
[Binding to data attributes](#data-binding)|Map series are based on custom data in addition to geographic coordinates and/or triangles. You can access and display custom data attributes (or members of data records) in tooltips or custom markers.


### <a id="different-map-providers"></a>Support for different map providers

The actual map background displayed in the `igMap` control is content retrieved from a map provider. The `igMap` can use different map providers. The map providers deliver the map images and the map series are plotted as overlays over this background content.

The `igMap` control supports the following map providers:

-   OpenStreetMap
-   Bing Maps
-   CloudMade Maps

>**Note:** Bing Maps and CloudMade maps require you to provide your custom access key to access their content.

The table below shows the same map area and geographic symbol series with the three available map providers.

OpenStreetMap|Bing Maps|CloudMade Maps
---|---|---

### <a id="zooming"></a>Zooming

Zooming allows details for a specific map area to be revealed by zooming in or a larger scale view to be displayed by zooming out. Zooming in and out can be performed directly by the user with the keyboard and/or mouse, by touching, holding and dragging on touch devices or with the help of the Overview Plus Detail (OPD) screen. Zooming can also be performed programmatically using the [windowRect](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igMap#options:windowRect) option of the `igMap` control.

The following table shows an initial map view and zoomed in view.

###<a id="panning"></a> Panning

Panning allows the currently displayed window from the map to be moved to the North, South, East or West. Panning can be performed directly by the user with keyboard and/or mouse, by touching, holding and dragging on touch devices or with the help of the Overview Plus Detail (OPD) screen. Zooming can also be performed programmatically using the [windowRect](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igMap#options:windowRect) option of the `igMap` control.

The following table shows an initial map view and then the same view slightly panned to the East.

### <a id="tooltips"></a>Tooltips

Tooltips allow you to display information about a specific point or region on the map. Tooltips are displayed when the user hovers with the mouse pointer over a marker or shape area on the map or touches and holds on touch enabled devices. Tooltips are based on templates which can render custom HTML markup and access data bound to a particular area of the map. Rendering of the templates is performed by the `igTemplating` engine. (For details, see [igTemplating](igTemplating-Overview.html)).

The following picture shows a geographic symbol series map with a tooltip activated on a point of the series.

![](images/Overview_%28igMap%29_14.png)

-   [Configuring the Visual Features](igMap-Configuring-Visual-Features.html)

###<a id="customizable-markers"></a> Customizable markers

The `igMap` control uses markers to designate points on the map for the geographic symbol and geographic shapes series. Markers can be of several built-in shapes and their outline color and thickness, and fill color can be controlled by the `igMap` control’s properties or CSS. You can also disable displaying of markers if that makes sense for your application. The standard markers are circle, triangle, pyramid, square, diamond, pentagon, hexagon, tetragram, pentagram, and hexagram, but you can configure custom markers as well.

The following picture shows a map region with some points denoted by square markers.

![](images/Overview_%28igMap%29_15.png)

If the shapes and behavior of the built-in markers are not sufficient you can configure a custom marker drawing function to be called whenever a marker is to be plotted on the map. Any custom marker function receives an object with the Canvas context object, position and size of the marker area and the data item bound to the marker. Additionally, another function can be provided to calculate and return custom size for the marker. The marker drawing function can use the full HTML5 Canvas API to draw whatever suits the requirements of the client application or web page.

The following picture shows a map with custom markers which display detailed information about data points.

![](images/Overview_%28igMap%29_16.png)

### Related Topics:

-   [Configuring the Visual Features](igMap-Configuring-Visual-Features.html)

### <a id="customizable-appearance"></a>Customizable look-and-fill of the series

The visual components of the series, like outlines, shapes, and fills, can be configured in terms of line thickness and patterns, color, color gradient, opacity, and so on. The exact customizations that can be applied are specific for each series type.

-   **Geographic Symbols, Geographic Shapes, and Geographic Polyline series**

For the Geographic Symbols, Geographic Shapes, and Geographic Polyline series, the nature of the visualization requires outlines and fills to be drawn. You can specify color, opacity and line thickness for markers and shapes outlines, and for polylines using the standard HTML colors or the rgba syntax. You can specify color and opacity for the fill of markers and shapes. All these aspects are configurable both by options and by CSS.

The following picture shows a geographic shapes series map with some custom colors applied.

![](images/Overview_%28igMap%29_17.png)

-   **Geographic Scatter Area and Geographic Contour Line series**

The Geographic Scatter Area and Geographic Contour Line series use a palette of colors to be used for the visualization. The actual color for each point is picked from the palette based on a configurable data attribute, and minimum and maximum values. The palette of colors can be configured and may contain an arbitrary number of colors. The first color in the palette is applied to values below the minimum value and the last color is applied to values greater than the maximum value.

The following picture shows a geographic scatter area map with custom palette.

![](images/Overview_%28igMap%29_18.png)

-   **Geographic Shape Series**

The Geographic Shape Series allows you to set different colors for fill and outline for each shape. This is accomplished by specifying a custom function to be called for each shape being plotted. The function can apply custom logic based on the data bound to the particular shape to select outline and fill color. This is useful for plotting political maps or designating arbitrary geographical regions by color depending on some of their data attributes.

The following figure shows the World map with countries in different colors based on their population.

##<a id="data-binding"></a>Data Binding

### Data binding summary

Map series are based on custom data in addition to geographic
coordinates and/or triangles. You can access and display custom data
attributes (or members of data records) in tooltips or custom markers.

The essence of the map overlays is that they are based on some data records bound to the specified geographic coordinates. The `igMap` control needs geographic data in the form of single or connected points, or triangles and can bind arbitrary additional data attributes to each geographic element. The data bound to each are accessible in tooltip templates or in different callback methods which the control may invoke to customize the look and feel of the visualization. The control recognizes and works with simple points specified in geographical latitude and longitude, with shape files together with database (DBF) files.
