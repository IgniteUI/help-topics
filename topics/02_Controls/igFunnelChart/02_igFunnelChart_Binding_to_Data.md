## <a id="data-sources"></a> Binding to Data Sources

### Data sources summary

Bind data to `igFunnelChart` in the same way you would bind any other control to the %%ProductName%%® library. Data is bound either by assigning a data source to the `dataSource` option or by providing a URL in the `dataSourceUrl` if data is provided by a web or Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service. The `igFunnelChart` control creates and uses an `igDataSource` object to handle data.

### Supported data sources listing

The `igFunnelChart` control supports the following data sources:

-   JavaScript array
-   JSON
-   XML
-   IQueryable&lt;T&gt;
-   [*igDataSource*](igDataSource-igDataSource.html)

### Requirements

Each data source has different requirements for data binding to the `igFunnelChart` control. The following table lists each requirement category.

<table class="table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Requirement category</th>
			<th>Requirement listing</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Data structures</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>JSON (client side from a web or WCF service, or from an MVC controller action)</li>
					<li>XML (client side or from a web or WCF service)</li>
					<li>JavaScript array</li>
					<li>IQueryable&lt;T&gt; in ASP.NET MVC</li>
				</ul>

## <a id="javascript-array"></a> Code Example: Binding *igFunnelChart* to a JavaScript Array

### Description

One of the most common data binding scenarios is to visualize data from a JavaScript array of data objects on your web page. This example defines a sample array of objects with two data fields and configures a funnel chart using the array as the data source.

### Code

The following snippet **defines a JavaScript array**. Put the snippet into a script block in your page.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
var data = [
    { Budget: 30, Department: "Administration" },
    { Budget: 50, Department: "Sales" },
    { Budget: 60, Department: "IT" },
    { Budget: 50, Department: "Marketing" },
    { Budget: 100, Department: "Development" },
    { Budget: 20, Department: "Support" }
];
```

The following snippet instantiates a funnel chart and **binds the chart to the array** defined above. This example only shows the essential data binding code omitting all other instantiation details.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$("#funnel").igFunnelChart({
    . . .    
    dataSource: data,
    valueMemberPath: "Budget",
    innerLabelMemberPath: "Budget",
    outerLabelMemberPath: "Department"
});
```



## <a id="xml"></a> Code Example: Binding *igFunnelChart* to XML data

### Description

The `igFunnelChart` control supports XML structures as a data source with the help of the `igDataSource` component. This code example shows how to pass an XML structure to an `igDataSource` object and how to bind the data source object to the funnel chart control.

### Code

The following code snippet **defines an XML structure** with a JavaScript string. The structure contains nodes with two data attributes: Department and Budget.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
var xmlDoc = 
    '<CompanyBudget>' +
        '<BudgetEntry Department="Development" Budget="100" />' +
        '<BudgetEntry Department="IT" Budget="60" />' +
        '<BudgetEntry Department="Sales" Budget="60" />' +
        '<BudgetEntry Department="Marketing" Budget="50" />' +
        '<BudgetEntry Department="Administration" Budget="30" />' +
        '<BudgetEntry Department="Support" Budget="20" />' +
    '</CompanyBudget>';
```

The following code snippet shows how to **declare the structure of the XML data** into an `igDataSchema` object recognizable by the `igDataSource`.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
var xmlSchema = new $.ig.DataSchema("xml",
    {
        searchField: "//BudgetEntry",
        fields: [
            { name: "Department", xpath: "./@Department" },
            { name: "Budget", xpath: "./@Budget", type: "number" }
        ]
    }
);
```

The following code snippet shows how to **instantiate an `igDataSource` using the XML data and the schema object**.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
var ds = new $.ig.DataSource({
    type: "xml",
    dataSource: xmlDoc,
    schema: xmlSchema
});
```

The following code snippet shows **instantiation code for the `igFunnelChart` control that binds to the data source** created above. The data source object handles the data from the XML structure and provides it in a suitable form to the funnel chart control.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$("#chartNormal").igFunnelChart({
    . . .
    dataSource: ds,
    valueMemberPath: "Budget",
    innerLabelMemberPath: "Budget",
    outerLabelMemberPath: "Department"
});
```



## <a id="mvc-model"></a> Code Example: Binding *igFunnelChart* in a Strongly Typed MVC View

### Description

In an MVC application you will usually want to have a strongly-typed View and pass it data objects from the business logic layer of your application. This example provides the essential code which defines a sample data class and passes a model object to the `igFunnelChart` MVC helper which instantiates a funnel chart. The data model object is required to be an IQueryable of the data class.

### Code

The next code snippet **declares a sample class** consisting of two data fields.

**In C#:**

```csharp
public class BudgetData
{
    public decimal Budget { get; set; }
    public string Department { get; set; }
}
```

The following code snippet specifies a strongly-typed MVC View at the beginning. Then it shows how to use the MVC helper for `igFunnelChart` in order to **bind to the Model object of the View**.

**In ASPX:**

```csharp
@model IQueryable<MvcApp.Models.BudgetData>
. . .
@(Html.Infragistics().FunnelChart(Model)
    .ID("funnel")
    . . .
    .ValueMemberPath("Budget")
    .InnerLabelMemberPath("Budget")
    .OuterLabelMemberPath("Department")
    .DataBind()
    .Render()
)
```



## <a id="remote-service-json"></a> Code Example: Binding *igFunnelChart* to a JSON Response from a Remote Service

### Description

This code example shows how to bind JSON data from a request to a remote service (MVC controller action in this case) to the `igFunnelChart` control.

### Code

The next code snippet **declares a sample class** consisting of two data fields.

**In C#:**

```csharp
public class BudgetData
{
    public decimal Budget { get; set; }
    public string Department { get; set; }
}
```

The following code snippet defines a controller **action method that services a remote request**. The method uses `getData()` method to implement the actual data retrieval logic and is not shown here.

**In C#:**

```csharp
[ActionName("getBudget")]
public JsonResult GetBudget()
{
    var data = getData();
    return new JsonResult 
    { 
        Data = data, 
        JsonRequestBehavior = JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet 
    };
}
```

The following code snippet contains **instantiation code for the `igFunnelChart` control that configures a URL for a remote data service**. The code snippet contains only the essential data binding code omitting all other instantiation options.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
$("#chartRemote").igFunnelChart({
    . . .
    dataSourceUrl: "/businessLogic/getBudget",
    valueMemberPath: "Budget",
    innerLabelMemberPath: "Budget",
    outerLabelMemberPath: "Department"
});
```
