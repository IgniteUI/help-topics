### <a id="overview"></a>Overview

This topic takes you step-by-step toward adding a radial gauge to a web page The following is a conceptual overview of the process:

1.  Adding references to the required resources
    -   Overview
    -   Referencing resources in JavaScript using the `igLoader`
    -   Referencing resources manually

2.  Add HTML markup required by the `igRadialGauge`
3.  Instantiate the radial gauge 
4.  (Optional) Verifying the result

### <a id="steps"></a>Steps

The following steps demonstrate how to add an `igRadialGauge` control to a web page.

1. Add references to the required resources.

	**Overview**
	
	Reference the required resources. Referencing resources includes:
	
	-   Adding the jQuery, jQueryUI and Modernizr JavaScript resources to a folder named Scripts in your web site or web application.
	-   Adding the %%ProductName%% CSS files to a folder named Content/ig in your web site or web application (see the [Styling and Theming in %%ProductName%%](Deployment-Guide-Styling-and-Theming.html) topic for details).
	-   Adding the %%ProductName%% JavaScript files to a folder named Scripts/ig in your web site or web application (see the [Using JavaScript Resources in %%ProductName%%](Deployment-Guide-JavaScript-Resources.html) topic for details).
	
	**The resources can be added either manually or using loaders** (recommended).
	
	Referencing resources in JavaScript using the igLoader
	
	The `igLoader`™ control is the recommended way to load JavaScript and CSS resources required by the %%ProductName%% library controls. First the igLoader script must be included in the page:
	
	**In HTML:**
	
	```html
	<script  type="text/javascript" src="Content/ig/infragistics.loader.js"></script>
	```
	
	For HTML views the igLoader must be instantiated this way:
	
	**In HTML:**
	
	```html
	<script type="text/javascript">
	    $.ig.loader({
	        scriptPath: "Scripts/ig/",
	        cssPath: "Content/ig/",
	        resources: "igRadialGauge"
	    });
	<script>
	```
	
	The resources option specifies that the `igRadialGauge` control will be rendered.

2. Add HTML markup required by the `igRadialGauge`.

	**HTML example**
	
	Add the div elements for the radial gauge which will be referred in the gauge instantiation code.
	
	**In HTML:**
	
	```html
	<div id="gauge" class="gaugeContainer"></div>
	```

3. Instantiate the radial gauge.

	HTML example
	
	For the gauge div tags to be wrapped and the gauge drawn, the `igRadialGauge` control must be instantiated and its main options set. Add the code below to the existing code in the `<script>` tag used above for data array definition:
	
	**In Javascript:**
	
	```js
	$(function () {
	    $("#gauge").igRadialGauge({
	        width: "450px",
	        height: "450px"
	    });
	});
	```  

4. (Optional) Verify the result.

	To verify the result, save the page and view the final result in a web browser. The radial gauge should render as shown in the [Preview](#preview).
