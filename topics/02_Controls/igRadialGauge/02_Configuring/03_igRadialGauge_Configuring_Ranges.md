# Configuring Ranges (igRadialGauge)



## Topic Overview
### Purpose

This topic provides a conceptual overview of the `igRadialGauge`™ control’s ranges. It describes the properties of the ranges and provides an example of how to add ranges to the radial gauge.

### Required background

The following topics are prerequisites to understanding this topic:

- [igRadialGauge](igRadialGauge.html): This section gives you an overview of the `igRadialGauge`™ control and its main features.

- [Adding igRadialGauge](igRadialGauge-Getting-Started-with-igRadialGauge.html): This topic explains using a code example how to add the `igRadialGauge`™ control to a page.

### In this topic

This topic contains the following sections:

-   [Ranges Overview](#overview)
-   [Preview](#preview)
-   [Range Properties](#range-properties)
-   [Configuring the Range](#config-range)
-   [Related Content](#RelatedContent)

### Ranges overview

A range highlights a set of continuous values bound by a specified minimum and maximum value on a gauge scale. You can add multiple ranges to a scale, specifying different brushes, along with starting and ending values. To add a range to the `igRadialGauge` control, create a `radialGaugeRange` object and add it to the Ranges collection.

### <a id="preview"></a>Preview

The following image is a preview of the `igRadialGauge` control with the three ranges added to it (0-30; 30-70 and 70-100):

### Range properties summary

The following table summarizes the properties of the `radialGaugeRange`:

Property Name| Property Type| Description
---|---|---
`brush`|brush|The color assigned to the range
`startValue`|double|The starting value at which to begin the range
`endValue`|double|The ending value at which to end the range
`innerStartExtent`|double|The distance from the center of the gauge (typically from 0 to 1) at which to start rendering the inner sweep of the range. Use values further from 0 than 1 to make the range extend beyond the normal radius of the gauge.
`innerEndExtent`|double|The distance from the center of the gauge (typically from 0 to 1) at which to end rendering the inner sweep of the range. Use values further from 0 than 1 to make the range extend further than the normal radius of the gauge.
`outerStartExtent`|double|The distance from the center of the gauge (from 0 to 1) at which to start rendering the outer sweep of the range. Use values further from 0 than 1 to make this extend further than the normal radius of the gauge.
`outerEndExtent`|double|The distance from the center of the gauge (from 0 to 1) at which to end rendering the outer sweep of the range. Use values further from 0 than 1 to make this extend further than the normal radius of the gauge.

### Example

The following screenshot demonstrates how the `igRadialGauge` control renders using this `igRadialGaugeRange` configuration:

Property| Value
---|---
`brush`|Blue
`startValue`|70
`endValue`|100
`outerStartExtent`|0.55
`outerEndExtent`|0.65

The following is the code that implements this example:

 **In JavaScript:**  

```js 
$("#gauge").igRadialGauge({
	width: "400px",
	height: "400px",
	ranges: [{
		name: "range1",
		brush: "rgba(164, 189, 41, 1)",
		startValue: 70,
		endValue: 100,
		outerStartExtent:  0.55,
		outerEndExtent: 0.65
	}]                                      
});                                                                  
```
