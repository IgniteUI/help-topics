### Needles overview

A gauge needle is a visual element used to signify a gauge set value and consists of needle cap overlays or underlays; the gauge needle’s pivot point. The supported needle shapes and caps are set using the `needleShape` and `needlePivotShape` properties. For a visual representation of the different needle shape and the pivot shape refer to the needle sample

### <a id="preview"></a>Preview

The following image is a preview of the `igRadialGauge` control with the needle’s value property set to 60:

### Example

The following screenshot demonstrates how the `igRadialGauge` control with the properties of the needle looks as a result of the following setting:

Property| Value
---|---
`value`|60
`needleEndExtent`|0.5
`needleShape`|rectangle
`pivotShape`|circleWithHole



![](images/igRadialGauge_Needle_02.png)

The following is the code that implements this example:

 **In JavaScript:**

```js
$("#gauge").igRadialGauge({
	width: "400px",
	height: "400px",
	value: 60,
	endExtent: 0.5,
	needleShape: "rectangle",
	needlePivotShape: "circleWithHole"                                  
});                                                                  
```
