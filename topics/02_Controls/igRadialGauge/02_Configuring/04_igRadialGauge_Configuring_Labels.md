# Configuring Labels (igRadialGauge)



## Topic Overview
### Purpose

This topic provides a conceptual overview of labels with the `igRadialGauge`™ control. It describes the properties of the labels and also provides an example of how to configure the labels.

### Required background

The following topics are prerequisites to understanding this topic:

- [igRadialGauge](igRadialGauge.html): This section gives you an overview of the `igRadialGauge`™ control and its main features.

- [Adding igRadialGauge](igRadialGauge-Getting-Started-with-igRadialGauge.html): This topic explains using a code example how to add the `igRadialGauge`™ control to a page.



### In this topic

This topic contains the following sections:

-   [Labels Overview](#overview)
-   [Preview](#preview)
-   [Label Properties and Events](#lable-properties)
-   [Configuring the Label](#config-lable)
-   [Related Content](#related-content)



##<a id="overview"></a>Labels Overview 

### Labels overview

The gauge labels are visual elements displaying numeric values at a specified interval on the scale.

### <a id="preview"></a>Preview

The following image is a preview of the `igRadialGauge` control displaying labels:

## <a id="lable-properties"></a>Label Properties and Events
### Label properties and events summary

The following table summarizes the `igRadialGauge` control’s label properties:

Property Name| Property Type| Description
---|---|---
labelExtent|double|Determines the label position as a value between 0 and 1 from the center of the gauge with 0 placing the labels at the center of the gauge and 1 placing the labels on the radius of the gauge.
labelInterval|double|Determines the interval to use for rendering labels; by default this is the same interval as the tick marks on the scale.


The following table summarizes the `igRadialGauge` control’s label related events.

Event Name| Description
---|---
alignLabel|This event is raised when aligning a gauge label along the scale
formatLabel|This event is raised when formatting a gauge label

### Example

The following screenshot illustrates how the `igRadialGauge` control renders with the label’s properties configured like this:

Property| Value
---|---
labelInterval| 15
labelExtent |0.44

The following is the code for implementing this example:

 **In JavaScript:**   
                                                                                                                                  
```js 
$("#gauge").igRadialGauge({
	width: "400px",
	height: "400px",
	labelExtent: 0.44,
	labelInterval: 15 
});                                                                  
```
