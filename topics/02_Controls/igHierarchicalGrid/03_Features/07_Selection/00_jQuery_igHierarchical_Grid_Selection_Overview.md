## <a id="introduction"></a> Introduction

The selection feature enables the selection of the rows and cells in the igHierarchicalGrid™ control. Its functionality closely follows the Microsoft® Windows Explorer™ and Microsoft® Excel™ selection and activation behaviors.

Hierarchical Grid selection comes with robust client-side-event support, providing the necessary tools for managing the control’s behavior at run time.

> **Note:** To enable drag-select functionality on touch-enabled devices, you need to include the [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) library on your page.

### <a id="row-selection"></a> Row selection

To enable row selection, you must enable the selection feature by setting the mode property to row (note that the row selection is the default behavior).

After enabling row selection, users can select a row by clicking on any of the row’s cells. If activation property is set to true you can use the keyboard to select rows. Rows can be selected in code by using the API.
