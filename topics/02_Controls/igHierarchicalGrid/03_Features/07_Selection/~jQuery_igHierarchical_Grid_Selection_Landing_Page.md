# Selection (igHierarchicalGrid)

## Introduction

The selection feature enables the selection of the rows and cells of the igHierarchicalGrid™ control. Its functionality closely follows the Microsoft® Windows Explorer™ and Microsoft® Excel™ selection and activation behaviors.

Hierarchical Grid selection comes with robust client-side-event support, providing the necessary tools for managing the control’s behavior at run time.
