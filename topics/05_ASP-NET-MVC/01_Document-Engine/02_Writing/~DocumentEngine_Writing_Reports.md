# Writing Reports

When writing reports, there are two main types of elements that you will use. The first type, layout and content elements, allow you to set up your report's logical flow and add whatever content you need to it. The second type of element is the graphical element. Graphic elements are more like support elements; they augment your report by adding color, shapes, and fonts.

Click the links below to explore the different elements that you can use to design your report.
