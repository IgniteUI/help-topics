## igListView Accessibility Compliance

All of the Ignite UI™ Mobile controls and components comply with Section 508, Subpart 1194.22 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Accessibility Compliance Reference chart that follows contains the specific rules of Subpart 1194.22 that pertain to the control. Also detailed is how the list view control complies with each rule.

Apart from Section 508 we are also following [Mobile Web Best Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/) guide and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) guide.

To meet the requirements each accessibility rule, in some cases, you may need to interact with the control by to setting a specific property, but in other cases the control does the work for you.

> **Note:** As jQuery Mobile controls are client-only, some of the rules are not supported and are indicated as limitations.
