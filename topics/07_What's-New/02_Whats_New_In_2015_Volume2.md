##General

### <a id="igniteui-scaffolder"></a> New Ignite UI Scaffolder for MVC

We release a brand new Scaffolder for Ignite UI widgets. With this we boost developer productivity greatly by providing code generation and templates to quickly target standard data scenarios like creating, reading, updating and deleting data. With a few clicks you can completely configure a Grid, generate a controller and save time on manual coding. Configuring other widgets as HierarchicalGrid, TreeGrid, Data Chart and others are already in the works.
Along with the standard templates for create, edit, delete, details and list that ship with ASP.NET MVC, we provide customized Ignite UI templates that use the new editor widgets.

## igCombo
### <a id="combo-grouping"></a>
####Grouping

![](images/combo-grouping.png)

####DropDown orientation
By default the dropdown orientation is set to 'auto' and this means that according to the available space above and below the combo, the dropdown position will be calculated automatically. You can set the value to be 'bottom' in order to open in below, and 'top' for above.

## igDataChart

### <a id="chart-axis-intervals"></a> New Axis Intervals

The igDataChart now allows you to implement both Major and Minor intervals for all Numeric and Category type axes, via the Interval and MinorInterval properties. This feature also includes the ability to customize the color and thickness for intervals via the MajorStroke, MajorThickness, MinorStroke and MinorThickness properties, exposed from the chart axes.

The following example demonstrates the use of Major and Minor Axis Intervals on the NumericX Axis of an igDataChart LineSeries.

## Editors

### <a id="new-editors"></a> New Editors

One of our main goals with this release was to provide you with more robust, feature rich and excellent performing editor widgets. Our editor components offer a lot of functionality, backed by a significant amount of code. This latest release marked another major development campaign for the editor suite, since our dev teams re-architected all editors to optimize their usability and also added a new component – the Checkbox widget.
Here are some of the main goals of the new editors:
 - Superior User Experience - We revisited the whole UX of every editor so now we provide much better experience out of the box. We include HTML5 editing benefits, modern look and feel and touch-friendly interface. We took care of every detail from label positioning to validation and interaction in different states.
 - More Intuitive API - No need to look at the help topics again. We made it so intuitive, so discoverable that you basically sit and code like it was you who wrote the control. The new API talks more for itself and is freed from unnecessary methods and options.
 - Improved Reliability - Reduced code complexity, increased performance and high testability are just part of the overall higher quality we ship with this new release.

## igGrid

### <a id="grid-refactored-updating"></a> Refactored Updating
The newly refactored grid Updating feature takes advantage of the new Editors and validation mechanisms. Also new is the refactored dialog edit mode (now renamed to "Row Edit Dialog" to better reflect its purpose), which offers a redesigned look and a new architecture, which makes it very easy to customize it. See [Migrating to the new Updating (igGrid)](iggrid-updating-migrating-to-the-new-updating.html) for information on how to migrate to the refactored Updating feature. 
Last, but not least, the new updating functionality of the grid component has been refactored to make the code lighter, more flexible and optimized.

### <a id="grid-filtering-improvements"></a> Filtering Improvements

You can now add a custom filter condition and choose the filtering conditions for a specific column.

Two new options are introduced in the Filtering feature:
- [`customConditions`](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.iggridfiltering#options:columnSettings.customConditions) - an array of objects defining custom condtions per column basis.

![](images/filtering_custom_conditions.png)

- [`conditionList`](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.iggridfiltering#options:columnSettings.conditionList) - an array of consitions to be enabled per column basis.

#### Related Samples

### <a id="grid-row-selectors-improvements"></a> RowSelectors Improvements
When Paging feature is enabled in combination with Row Selectors an additional UI is introduced to allow users to select all rows across all pages.

![](images/grid_improvements_row_selectors.png)

This functionality can be enabled via the [enableSelectAllForPaging](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.iggridrowselectors#options:enableSelectAllForPaging) option together with [enableCheckBoxes](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.iggridrowselectors#options:enableCheckBoxes) and [multipleSelection](%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.iggridselection#options:multipleSelection) options.

## igTreeGrid

### <a id="treegrid-row-selectors"></a> Row Selectors

The Row Selectors feature for the igTreeGrid is extended from the igGrid RowSelectors. 
The feature is customized to ease selection in hierarchical data by introducing two new functionalities: hierarchical numbering mode and tri-state checkboxes.
In hierarchical numbering mode row number includes the counters for each level in the hierarchy. The functionality is controlled by the [`rowSelectorNumberingMode`](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igtreegridrowselectors#options:rowSelectorNumberingMode) option.

![](images/tregrid_row_selectors_hierarchical_numbering_mode.png)
 
Tri-state checkboxes introduces a partially checked state to indicate that a partent row has checked child rows. The functionality is controlled by the [`checkBoxMode`](%%jQueryApiUrl%%/ui.igtreegridrowselectors#options:checkBoxMode) option.

![](images/tregrid_row_selectors_tri_state_checkboxes.png)

Additionally when Paging feature is enabled in combination with Row Selectors an additional UI is introduced to allow users to select all rows across all pages.

### <a id="treegrid-remote-mvc-features"></a> Remote Sorting, Paging, Filtering and Load on Demand in the TreeGrid MVC Wrapper

TreeGrid MVC Wrapper now handles the Sorting, Paging, Filtering and Load on Demand remote operations out of the box.
You just need to decorate the action that handles the remote features with the `TreeGridDataSourceAction` attribute.

### <a id="treegrid-paging-context-row"></a> Paging Context Row

With large hierarchical data sets sometimes you might find yourself in trouble figuring out where you are in the hierarchy. We add a new paging context row to communicate the context of a leaf level row. This shows a trail representing the full path of the leaf through all ancestors. The available contexts are:
    - none - context row is not rendered.
    - parent - renders a read-only representation of the immediate parent row.
    - breadcrumb - renders a read-only breadcrumb trail representing the full path through all ancestors.
The functionality is controlled by the [`contextRowMode`](%%jQueryApiUrl%%ui.igtreegridpaging#options:contextRowMode) option.

## igNotifier

### <a id="notifier"></a> New component

The Notifier component is an extension of the Popover component, which specializes in providing the end user with notification information. There are four predefined states of notification - success, info, warning, and error. 
The component supports a popover mode, as well as simple inline-style messaging. In addition to this, there is automatic pairing with editor widgets to allow detection of erroneous input, which is outside of the predefined range. 
Whether used with an Ignite UI widget or on its own, the Notifier component provides an easy and intuitive way to improve user experience.

## igValidator

### <a id="validator"></a> Refactored Validator

The refactored igValidator component allows flexible validation on an array of Ignite UI components, as well as standard input form elements. The mechanism uses the igNotification component capabilities to both handle the validation process and display flexible and visually appealing notifications to the end user. See [Migrating to the new igValidator control](igvalidator-migration-topic.html) for information on how to migrate to the refactored igValidator.
