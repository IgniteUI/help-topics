## igGrid
### <a id="iggrid-column-moving"></a>Column Moving feature is RTM

Column Moving is a feature of the `igGrid`/`igHierarchicalGrid` that enables changing the position of a column in the grid and, in effect, reordering of the grid’s columns. This can be performed either by the user from the grid interface or programmatically through the API of the Column Moving feature. The user can move columns by either dragging them or through selecting the desire column position from a special column moving interface (invoked with a button in the column header). Dragging is not supported on touch-enabled devices.

### <a id="responsive-web-design"></a>Responsive Web Design Mode

The Responsive Web Design (RWD) Mode feature of the `igGrid` control adopts the concepts of [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) in order to improve the user experience on different devices. Responsive Web Design mode allows you to support multiple screen sizes and form factors with a single code base and design.

In RWD mode, the grid’s adaptation to the devices’ screen can be configured to be either:

-   Auto-hiding of columns

This is configured through the RWD mode feature’s column hiding functionality.

-   Any structural and formatting change that can be implemented through a grid template

To this end, the RWD Mode feature supports a set of pre-defined grid templates which replace the `igGrid` template once the RWD mode feature is enabled. Using templates allows for a wide scope of adaptations, including row hiding, using different fonts and font sizes, merging several rows/columns in one row/column, and many others.

## <a id="igupload-general-improvements"></a>igUpload
### General Improvements

`igUpload` uses [XMLHttpRequest Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/) to get the status of the uploading file on browsers which implement this specification. HTTP Handler is not used in this case.

### <a id="saving-files-as-memorystream"></a>Saving Files as MemoryStream

A new application wide option `FileSaveType` is added for the `igUpload` MVC Wrapper. This option accepts 2 values: filestream and memorystream. By default, the option is set to filestream. This mode enables the functionality available so far in the `igUpload` MVC Wrapper.

The new memorystream option enables saving a file as memory stream functionality. In this mode, you can process the uploaded files as `MemoryStream` objects by handling the `FileUploading` event.

### <a id="selecting-multiple-files"></a>Selecting multiple files at once for upload

Multiple files selection leverages the [HTML 5 multiple attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.file.html#input.file.attrs.multiple) of the input element.

User can add multiple files to `igUpload` in two ways:

-   From an “Open file” dialog
-   By drag-and-drop on the `igUpload` control

The functionality is available only in the browsers which support multiple attribute of the input element.

## %%ProductName%% ASP.NET MVC Helpers
### <a id="support-adding-events"></a>Support for Adding Events

You can now add events to %%ProductName%% controls by adding them to the ASP.NET MVC helper. Use the `AddClientEvent` method to supply the event name and a handler function name. The helper will render to the appropriate instantiation JavaScript on the client to fire the event.

**In ASPX:**

```csharp
<%= Html.Infragistics().Combo()
    .DataSource(Model)
    .TextKey("DisplayText")
    .ValueKey("Value")
    .AddClientEvent("selectionChanged", "comboSelectionChanged")
    .Render()
%>
```

Note: `igUpload`, `igGrid`/`igHierarchicalGrid` and their features will get this functionality in the first service release for 13.1.
