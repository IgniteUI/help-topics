## <a id="igbulletgraph"></a>igBulletGraph
### <a id="igbulletgraph-new-control"></a>New control

The `igBulletGraph` control is a data visualization control for visualizing data in the form of a bullet graph. Linear by design, it provides a simple and concise view of a performance bar compared against a scale and, optionally, some other measures.

## <a id="igdatachart"></a>igDataChart
### <a id="title-subtitle"></a>Title and subtitle

You can now add a title and/or subtitle to the top section of the chart. When a title/subtitle is added, the content of the chart is re-sized automatically to allow for the title/subtitle content.

### <a id="series-highting"></a>Series highlighting

You can now highlight an entire series or some individual items within
the series.

The highlighting capabilities are series-specific. With single-shape series, such as Line, series the entire line is highlighted, while with series consisting of multiple shapes, such as Column series, each individual shape (column) can be highlighted. In all supported series, individual markers can be highlighted.

Highlighting is supported with the mouse only.

Series highlighting is supported for the following series types:

-   Category Series
-   Range Category Series
-   Financial Price Series
-   Financial Indicators

### <a id="hover-interactions"></a>Hover interactions

Hover interactions enable you to display annotations over the series of the chart. These annotations are implemented through configurable hover interaction layers that are dependent on the cursor position.

![](images/Whats_New_In_Ignite_UI_2013_Volume_2_4.png)

Hover interaction layers are actually series that are added to the series collection and are dependent on the cursor position. Adding hover interaction layers to the `igDataChart` control disables the default behavior of the crosshairs, tooltips, or both (depending on which type of layer is added).

### <a id="igdoughnutchart-new-control"></a>New control

The `igDoughnutChart` is a data visualization control for displaying data in the form of a doughnut chart. It allows for proportionally illustrating the occurrences of a variable. The inner radius of the control is configurable, and the Doughnut Chart’s series provides a built-in support for selecting and exploding its slices.

Visualizing the occurrence of multiple variables (adding multiple series) is possible, using concentric rings. The chart can be styled by configuring its properties or applying themes.

The new geographic High-Density Scatter series allows you to bind and
show scatter data ranging from hundreds to millions of data points
requiring exceedingly little loading time.

Because of the sheer number of data points, the series displays the scatter data as tiny dots (as opposed to full-size markers) and the areas the most data-intensive areas – higher color density representing clusters of data points.
