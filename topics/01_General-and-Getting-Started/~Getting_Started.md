## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

Ignite UI&trade; is an advanced HTML5+ toolset that helps you create stunning, modern Web apps. Building on jQuery and jQuery UI, it primarily consists of feature rich, high-performing UI controls/widgets such as all kinds of charts, data visualization maps, (hierarchical, editable) data grids, pivot grids, enhanced editors (combo box, masked editors, HTML editor, date picker, to name a few), flexible data source connectors, and a whole lot more.

Ignite UI comes in two vesions: 
-   Open Source - a free version that contains a subset of the complete toolset. Grids and Data Visualization controls are excluded. For more information checkout the [Ignite UI OSS](https://github.com/IgniteUI/ignite-ui) project on GitHub&trade;.
-   Full - a paid version that contains the complete toolset.

# <a id="hosting"></a>Host Ignite UI in your project

You have several options to host Ignite UI in your project:

- Use Package Manager like NPM, JSPM, NuGet
- Copy the [JavaScript and CSS files](Adding_the_Required_Resources_for_NetAdvantage_for_jQuery.html) from the Ignite UI installation directory into your project
- Use [Infragistics Content Delivery Network (CDN)](#cdn)

## <a id="package_managers"></a>Using NPM, JSPM, NuGet

Ignite UI supports a number of package managers: NPM, JSPM and NuGet.

NPM (installs [Ignite UI Open Source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ignite-ui))

```
    npm install ignite-ui
```

For instructions how to configure the full licensed package, please check [Using Ignite UI npm packages](Using_Ignite_UI_Npm_Packages.html) topic.

NuGet (installs [Ignite UI Trial](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IgniteUI/))

```
    Install-Package IgniteUI
```

```
    jspm install npm:ignite-ui
```

For instructions how to configure the full licensed package, please check [Using System.JS with Ignite UI controls](Using-System.JS-with-IgniteUI-controls.html) topic.

### <a id="add_references"></a>Add CSS and JavaScript references

Ignite UI depends on jQuery and jQuery UI libraries and you need to add references to them before the Ignite UI scripts. You also have several options to include the Ignite UI controls in the page
- Referencing combined and minified bundle files - installation comes with a combined and minified files which group controls by type. There are `infragistics.core.js` (mandatory), `infragistics.lob.js` which contains the Line of Business controls like Grids and `infragistics.dv.js` which contains the Data Visualization controls like Charts. For more information check [Adding Required Resources Manually](Adding_the_Required_Resources_for_NetAdvantage_for_jQuery.html) topic.
- Referencing individual control files - For more information check [JavaScript Files in Ignite UI](Deployment_Guide_JavaScript_Files.html) topic.
- Using Infragistics Loader - The Infragistics Loader is a loader that can automatically load Ignite UI files (and not only). It saves you the burden to reference control files manually. For more information check [Adding Required Resources Automatically with the Infragistics Loader](Using_Infragistics_Loader.html) topic.
- Using AMD Loader - Ignite UI is AMD compatible and can be used with all popular AMD loaders.

### <a id="boilerplate"></a>Sample Ignite UI Boilerplate HTML page (using trial CDN links)

The following code represents a sample boilerplate HTML page containing the required references (CDN links) needed to start using Ignite UI.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>

    <!-- Ignite UI Required Combined CSS Files -->
    <link href="http://cdn-na.infragistics.com/igniteui/latest/css/themes/infragistics/infragistics.theme.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="http://cdn-na.infragistics.com/igniteui/latest/css/structure/infragistics.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    
    <style>

        /* ----- CSS Goes Here ----- */

    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- ----- HTML Goes Here ----- -->

    <table id="grid"></table>

    <!-- JavaScript Library Dependencies -->
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Ignite UI Required Combined JavaScript Files -->
    <script src="http://cdn-na.infragistics.com/igniteui/latest/js/infragistics.core.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn-na.infragistics.com/igniteui/latest/js/infragistics.dv.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn-na.infragistics.com/igniteui/latest/js/infragistics.lob.js"></script>    
    <script>

        $(function () {

            // ----- JavaScript Goes Here ----- //

        });

    </script>

</body>
</html>
```

## <a id="first_control"></a>Add your first control

There are two options available: Directly or with Page Designer

### <a id="directly"></a>Add an igGrid Directly

<div class="embed-sample">
   [igGrid Paging](%%SamplesEmbedUrl%%/grid/paging)
</div>

### <a id="page_designer"></a>Add an igGrid using Page Designer

The Ignite UI [Page Designer](http://designer.igniteui.com/) gives you a complete designer experience to configure any Ignite UI control by only using the mouse.
To add `igGrid` to a page design area (on the left) in the toolbox (on the right) find "List & Pickers" section and drag and drop the Grid control. Then use the Property Editor to configure the grid. When ready just copy the resulting generated page.

## <a id="custom_download"></a>Get just what you need

The Ignite UI [Custom Download Page](https://www.igniteui.com/download) gives you the option to choose only the Ignite UI controls and features you use in your project and download optimized (minified and combined) JavaScript and CSS files for maximum page load performance.

## <a id="cdn"></a>Using CDN Links

Instead of hosting the Ignite UI script files into your project, you can just use Ignite UI CDN links. For Internet applications CDN usually serves files faster to the end users compared to host them on premise.

Following are the Ignite UI Trial links. For more details checkout [Infragistics Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Ignite UI](deployment_guide_infragistics_content_delivery_network%28cdn%29.html) topic.
