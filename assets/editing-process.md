# Editing Process
The editing process will vary slightly depending on if you have commit rights or not. For local forks in either case preferably run the [`grunt verify`](tools/checker) task to check for broken links/images before committing the changes.

## Without Commit Rights
If you do not have commit rights to the repository, then you can [submit changes via a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). Once your request is received then a team member will work with you to edit the topic to make it publish-ready.

## With Commit Rights
For those with commit rights, you will:

- Create a branch for your new or edited topic
- Commit changes to that branch
- Create an [issue and assign it to the person responsible for review](https://github.com/igniteui/help-topics/issues)
- Once approved then you copy or merge the changes in your temporary branch to the appropriate production branches
- Delete your editing branch
